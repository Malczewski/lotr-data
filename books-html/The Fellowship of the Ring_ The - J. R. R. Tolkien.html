            NOTE ON THE TEXT</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="p1">J.R.R. Tolkien’s <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is often erroneously called a trilogy, when it is in fact a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes&#13;
         published in three volumes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The first volume, <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, was published in Great Britain by the London firm George Allen &amp; Unwin on 29 July 1954; an American edition followed on&#13;
         21 October of the same year, published by Houghton Mifflin Company of Boston. In the production of this first volume, Tolkien&#13;
         experienced what became for him a continual problem: printer’s errors and compositor’s mistakes, including well-intentioned&#13;
         ‘corrections’ of his sometimes idiosyncratic usage. These ‘corrections’ include the altering of <em>dwarves</em> to <em>dwarfs</em>, <em>elvish</em> to <em>elfish</em>, <em>further</em> to <em>farther</em>, <em>nasturtians</em> to <em>nasturtiums</em>, <em>try and say</em> to <em>try to say</em> and (‘worst of all’ to Tolkien) <em>elven</em> to <em>elfin</em>. In a work such as <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, containing invented languages and delicately constructed nomenclatures, errors and inconsistencies impede both the understanding&#13;
         and the appreciation of serious readers – and Tolkien had many such readers from very early on. Even before the publication&#13;
         of the third volume, which contained much hitherto unrevealed information on the invented languages and writing systems, Tolkien&#13;
         received many letters from readers written in these systems, in addition to numerous enquiries on the finer points of their&#13;
         usage.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The second volume, <em>The Two Towers</em>, was published in England on 11 November 1954 and in the United States on 21 April 1955. Meanwhile Tolkien worked to keep&#13;
         a promise he had made in the foreword to volume one: that ‘an index of names and strange words’ would appear in the third&#13;
         volume. As originally planned, this index would contain much etymological information on the languages, particularly on the&#13;
         elven tongues, with a large vocabulary. It proved the chief &#13;
         <a id="pagexii"/>cause of the delay in publishing volume three, which in the end contained no index at all, only an apology from the publisher&#13;
         for its absence. For Tolkien had abandoned work on it after indexing volumes one and two, believing its size and therefore&#13;
         its cost to be ruinous.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Volume three, <em>The Return of the King</em>, finally appeared in England on 20 October 1955 and in the United States on 5 January 1956. With the appearance of the third&#13;
         volume, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was published in its entirety, and its first edition text remained virtually unchanged for a decade. Tolkien had made a few&#13;
         small corrections, but further errors entered <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> in its December 1954 second impression when the printer, having distributed the type after the first printing, reset the&#13;
         book without informing the author or publisher. These include misrepresentations of the original printed text – that is, words&#13;
         and phrases that read acceptably in context, but which depart from Tolkien’s wording as originally written and published.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In 1965, stemming from what then appeared to be copyright problems in the United States, an American paperback firm published&#13;
         an unauthorized and non-royalty-paying edition of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. For this new edition by Ace Books the text of the narrative was reset, thus introducing new typographical errors; the appendices,&#13;
         however, were reproduced photographically from the hardcover edition, and remain consistent with it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Tolkien set to work on his first revision of the text so that a newly revised and authorized edition could successfully compete&#13;
         on the American market. This first revision of the text was published in America in paperback by Ballantine Books, under licence&#13;
         from Houghton Mifflin, in October 1965. In addition to revisions within the text itself, Tolkien replaced his original foreword&#13;
         with a new one. He was pleased to remove the original foreword; in his check copy, he wrote of it: ‘confusing (as it does)&#13;
         real personal matters with the “machinery” of the Tale, is a serious mistake’. Tolkien also added an extension to the prologue&#13;
         and an index – not &#13;
         <a id="pagexiii"/>the detailed index of names promised in the first edition, but, rather, a bald index with only names and page references.&#13;
         Additionally, at this time the appendices were greatly revised.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Tolkien received his copies of the Ballantine edition in late January 1966, and in early February he recorded in his diary&#13;
         that he had ‘worked for some hours on the Appendices in Ballantine version &amp; found more errors than I at first expected’.&#13;
         Soon after this he sent a small number of further revisions to Ballantine for the appendices, including the now well-known&#13;
         addition of ‘Estella Bolger’ as wife of Meriadoc in the family trees in Appendix C. Most of these revisions, which entered&#13;
         variously in the third and fourth impressions ( June and August 1966) of volume three, and which were not always inserted&#13;
         correctly (thereby causing further confusion in the text), somehow never made it into the main sequence of revision in the&#13;
         three-volume British hardcover edition, and for long remained anomalies. Tolkien once wrote, concerning the revising of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, that perhaps he had failed to keep his notes in order; this errant branch of revision seems likely to be an example of that&#13;
         disorder – either in his notes or in the ability of his publishers to follow them with utmost accuracy.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The revised text first appeared in Great Britain in a three-volume hardcover ‘Second Edition’ from Allen &amp; Unwin on 27 October&#13;
         1966. But again there were problems. Although the revisions Tolkien sent to America of the text itself were available to be&#13;
         utilized in the new British edition, his extensive revisions to the appendices were lost after being entered into the Ballantine&#13;
         edition. Allen &amp; Unwin were forced to reset the appendices using the copy as published in the first Ballantine edition. This&#13;
         did not include Tolkien’s second, small set of revisions sent to Ballantine; but, more significantly, it did include a great&#13;
         number of errors and omissions, many of which were not discovered until long afterwards. Thus, in the appendices, a close&#13;
         scrutiny of the first edition text and of the much later corrected impressions of the second edition &#13;
         <a id="pagexiv"/>is necessary to discern whether any particular change in this edition is authorial or erroneous.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In America, the revised text appeared in hardcover in the three-volume edition published by Houghton Mifflin on 27 February&#13;
         1967. This text was evidently photo-offset from the 1966 Allen &amp; Unwin three-volume hardcover, and is thus consistent with&#13;
         it. Aside from the first printing of this second Houghton Mifflin edition, which has a 1967 date on the title page, none of&#13;
         the many reprintings is dated. After the initial printings of this edition, which bore a 1966 copyright notice, the date of&#13;
         copyright was changed in 1965 to match the statement in the Ballantine edition. This change has caused a great deal of confusion&#13;
         for librarians and other researchers who have tried to sort out the sequence of publication of these editions.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Meanwhile, Tolkien spent much of the summer of 1966 further revising the text. In June he learned that any more revisions&#13;
         were too late for inclusion in the 1966 Allen &amp; Unwin second edition, and he recorded in his diary: ‘But I am attempting to&#13;
         complete my work [on the revisions] – I cannot leave it while it is all in my mind. So much time has been wasted in all my&#13;
         work by this constant breaking of threads.’ This was the last major set of revisions Tolkien himself made to the text during&#13;
         his lifetime. They were added to the second impression (1967) of the three-volume hard-cover Allen &amp; Unwin second edition.&#13;
         The revisions themselves mostly include corrections of nomenclature and attempts at consistency of usage throughout the three&#13;
         volumes. Some small alterations were made by Tolkien in the 1969 one-volume India paper edition.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>J.R.R. Tolkien died in 1973. His third son and literary executor, Christopher Tolkien, sent a large number of further corrections&#13;
         of misprints, mainly in the appendices and index, to Allen &amp; Unwin for use in their editions in 1974. Most of these corrections&#13;
         were typographical, and in line with his father’s expressed intent in his own check copies.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Since 1974, Christopher Tolkien has sent additional corrections, &#13;
         <a id="pagexv"/>as errors have been discovered, to the British publishers of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> (Allen &amp; Unwin, later Unwin Hyman, and now HarperCollins), who have tried to be conscientious in the impossible task of maintaining&#13;
         a textual integrity in whichever editions of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> they have published. However, every time the text has been reset for publication in a new format (e.g. the various paperback&#13;
         editions published in England in the 1970s and 1980s), huge numbers of new misprints have crept in, though at times some of&#13;
         these errors have been observed and corrected in later printings. Still, throughout these years the three-volume British hardcover&#13;
         edition has retained the highest textual integrity.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In the United States, the text of the Ballantine paperback has remained unchanged for more than three decades after Tolkien&#13;
         added his few revisions in 1966. The text in all of the Houghton Mifflin editions remained unchanged from 1967 until 1987,&#13;
         when Houghton Mifflin photo-offset the then current three-volume British hardcover edition in order to update the text used&#13;
         in their editions. In those new reprintings a number of further corrections (overseen by Christopher Tolkien) were added,&#13;
         and the errant Ballantine branch of revision (including the ‘Estella Bolger’ addition) was integrated into the main branch&#13;
         of textual descent. This method of correction involved a cut-and-paste process with printed versions of the text. Beginning&#13;
         with the 1987 Houghton Mifflin edition, an earlier version of this ‘Note on the Text’ (dated October 1986) was added to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. This ‘Note’ has been reworked three times since then – the version dated April 1993 first appeared in 1994, and the version&#13;
         dated April 2002 came out later that year. The present ‘Note’ replaces and supersedes all previous versions.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>For the 1994 British edition published by HarperCollins, the text of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was entered into word-processing files. This next stage of textual evolution came about to allow for a greater uniformity&#13;
         of the text in all future editions, but with it, inevitably, came new wrinkles. Some &#13;
         <a id="pagexvi"/>new misreadings entered into the text, while at the same time others were fixed. In the worst instance, one line of the ring&#13;
         inscription in the chapter ‘The Shadow of the Past’ of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> was simply dropped. Unforeseeable glitches arose in other editions when the base computerized text was transferred into page-making&#13;
         or typesetting programs – e.g., in one edition of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, the closing two sentences of ‘The Council of Elrond’ simply and inexplicably disappeared. Such glitches have been very much&#13;
         the exception, not the rule, and the text has otherwise maintained a consistency and integrity throughout its computerized&#13;
         evolution.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The 1994 edition also contained a number of new corrections (again supervised by Christopher Tolkien), as well as a reconfigured&#13;
         index of names and page references. The 1994 text was first used in American editions published by Houghton Mifflin in 1999.&#13;
         A small number of further corrections were added into the 2002 three-volume edition illustrated by Alan Lee, published by&#13;
         HarperCollins in Great Britain and Houghton Mifflin in the United States.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The textual history of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, merely in its published form, is a vast and complex web. In this brief note I have given only a glimpse of the overall sequence&#13;
         and structure. Further details on the revisions and corrections made over the years to the published text of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and a fuller account of its publishing history, may be found in <em>J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography</em>, by Wayne G. Hammond, with the assistance of Douglas A. Anderson (1993).&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>For those interested in observing the gradual evolving of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> from its earliest drafts to its published form, I highly recommend Christopher Tolkien’s account, which appears within five&#13;
         volumes of his twelve-volume series <em>The History of Middle-earth</em>. Volumes six through nine contain the major part of his study pertaining to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>: <em>The Return of the Shadow</em> (1988); <em>The Treason of</em><a id="pagexvii"/><em>Isengard</em> (1989); <em>The War of the Ring</em> (1990); and <em>Sauron Defeated</em> (1992). Also, the final book of the series, <em>The Peoples of Middle-earth</em> (1996), covers the evolution of the prologue and appendices to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. These volumes contain an engrossing over-the-shoulder account of the growth and writing of Tolkien’s masterpiece.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The process of studying Tolkien’s manuscripts of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> involved the deciphering of versions where Tolkien wrote first in pencil and then in ink atop the pencilled draft. Christopher&#13;
         Tolkien has decribed his father’s method of composition in <em>The Return of the Shadow</em>: ‘In the handwriting that he used for rapid drafts and sketches, not intended to endure long before he turned to them again&#13;
         and gave them a more workable form, letters are so loosely formed that a word which cannot be deduced or guessed at from the&#13;
         context or from later versions can prove perfectly opaque after long examination; and if, as he often did, he used a soft&#13;
         pencil much has now become blurred and faint.’ The true difficulty of reading such double-drafts can be observed in the frontispiece&#13;
         to <em>The War of the Ring</em>, which reproduces in colour Tolkien’s illustration of ‘Shelob’s Lair’ from a page of Tolkien’s manuscript. Looking very closely&#13;
         at the hasty ink draft alongside the illustration, one can see underneath it the earlier, hastier, pencilled draft. Also in&#13;
         <em>The War of the Ring</em>, Christopher Tolkien reproduces a page from the first manuscript of the chapter ‘The Taming of Sméagol’, and the printed&#13;
         text corresponding to this text is on the facing page (see pp. 90–91). One is astonished at anyone’s ability to decipher such&#13;
         texts.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>That difficulty aside, just what do these books signify to ordinary readers and to Tolkien scholars? And what is ‘the history&#13;
         of the writing’ of a book? Simply, these volumes show in great detail the development of the story of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> from its very earliest drafts and hasty projections through its completion. We see in the earliest materials what is very&#13;
         much a children’s book, a sequel to <em>The Hobbit</em>, and as the story grows through various ‘phases’, there is an &#13;
         <a id="pagexviii"/>increase in seriousness and depth. We see alternate branches of development, the gradual blending and merging of certain characters,&#13;
         and the slow emergence of the nature of the rings and of the motivations of other characters. Some of these various ideas&#13;
         are abandoned altogether, while others are reworked into some variant form that may or may not survive into the final version.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>One could make a whole catalogue of interesting tidbits from Christopher Tolkien’s study – such as the fact that Strider was&#13;
         called Trotter until a very late stage in the writing of the book; that Trotter was at one time a hobbit, so named because&#13;
         he wore wooden shoes; that Tolkien at one point considered a romance between Aragorn and Éowyn; that Tolkien wrote an epilogue&#13;
         to the book, tying up loose ends, but it was dropped before publication (and now appears in <em>Sauron Defeated</em>); and so on. But these developments are best appreciated when read within the context of Christopher Tolkien’s commentary&#13;
         rather than discussed separately.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The most significant achievement of these volumes is that they show us how Tolkien wrote and thought. Nowhere else do we see&#13;
         the authorial process itself at work in such detail. Tolkien’s hastiest comments about where the story might proceed, or why&#13;
         it can or can’t go such and such a way – these queries to himself were written out: Tolkien is literally thinking on paper.&#13;
         This gives an added dimension of understanding to Tolkien’s comment to Stanley Unwin in a 1963 letter that, when suffering&#13;
         from trouble with his shoulder and right arm, ‘I found not being able to use a pen or pencil as defeating as the loss of her&#13;
         beak would be to a hen.’ And we, as readers of these volumes, can share with Tolkien himself the wonder and bewilderment of&#13;
         new characters appearing as if from nowhere, or of some other sudden change or development, at the very moment of their emergence&#13;
         into the story.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>I know of no other instance in literature where we have such a ‘history of the writing’ of a book, told mostly by the author&#13;
         himself, with all the hesitations and false paths laid &#13;
         <a id="pagexix"/>out before us, sorted out, commented upon, and served up to a reader like a feast. We are shown innumerable instances in the&#13;
         minutest detail of the thought-process itself at work. We see the author fully absorbed in creation for its own sake. And&#13;
         this is all the more exceptional because this is a history not only of the unfolding of a story and its text, but of the evolution&#13;
         of a world. There is an additional wealth of material beyond simple narrative text. There are maps and illustrations. There&#13;
         are languages and writing systems, and the histories of the peoples who spoke and wrote in these systems. All of these additional&#13;
         materials add multiple dimensions of complexity to our appreciation of the invented world itself.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Fifty years into the published life of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, it seems extraordinary to me that we have not only such a masterful work of literature but also as a companion to it an&#13;
         unparalleled account of its writing. Our gratitude as readers goes to both of the Tolkiens, father and son.&#13;

            NOTE ON THE 50<sup>TH</sup> ANNIVERSARY EDITION</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="p1"><a id="pagexx"/>In this edition of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, prepared for the fiftieth anniversary of its publication, between three and four hundred emendations have been made following&#13;
         an exhaustive review of past editions and printings. The present text is based on the setting of the HarperCollins three-volume&#13;
         hardcover edition of 2002, which in turn was a revision of the HarperCollins reset edition of 1994. As Douglas A. Anderson&#13;
         comments in the preceding ‘Note on the Text’, each of those editions was itself corrected, and each also introduced new errors.&#13;
         At the same time, other errors survived undetected, among them some five dozen which entered as long ago as 1954, in the resetting&#13;
         of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> published as its ‘second impression’.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>That the printer had quietly reset <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>, and that copies had been issued without proof having been read by the author, never became known to Tolkien; while his publisher,&#13;
         Rayner Unwin, learned of it only thirty-eight years after the fact. Tolkien found a few of the unauthorized changes introduced&#13;
         in the second printing when (probably while preparing the second edition in 1965) he read a copy of the twelfth impression&#13;
         (1962), but thought the errors newly made. These, among others, were corrected in the course of the reprinting. Then in 1992&#13;
         Eric Thompson, a reader with a keen eye for typographic detail, noticed small differences between the first and second impressions&#13;
         of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> and called them to the attention of the present editors. About one-sixth of the errors that entered in the second printing&#13;
         quickly came to light. Many more were revealed only recently, when Steven M. Frisby used ingenious optical aids to make a&#13;
         comparison of copies of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> in greater detail than was previously accomplished. &#13;
         <a id="pagexxi"/>We have gladly made full use of Mr Frisby’s results, which he has generously shared and discussed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In the course of its fifty-year history <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> has had many such readers who have recorded changes made between its various appearances in print, both to document what&#13;
         has gone before and to aid in the achievement of an authoritative text. Errors or possible errors were reported to the author&#13;
         himself or to his publishers, and information on the textual history of the work circulated among Tolkien enthusiasts at least&#13;
         as early as 1966, when Banks Mebane published his ‘Prolegomena to a Variorum Tolkien’ in the fanzine <em>Entmoot</em>. Most notably in later years, Douglas A. Anderson has been in the forefront of efforts to achieve an accurate text of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> (and of <em>The Hobbit</em>); Christina Scull has published ‘A Preliminary Study of Variations in Editions of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>’ in <em>Beyond Bree</em> (April and August 1985); Wayne G. Hammond has compiled extensive lists of textual changes in <em>J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography</em> (1993); and David Bratman has published an important article, ‘A Corrigenda to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>’, in the March 1994 number of <em>The Tolkien Collector</em>. The observations of Dainis Bisenieks, Yuval Welis, Charles Noad, and other readers, sent to us directly or posted in public&#13;
         forums, have also been of service.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Efforts such as these follow the example of the author of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> during his lifetime. His concern for the textual accuracy and coherence of his work is evident from the many emendations&#13;
         he made in later printings, and from notes he made for other emendations which for one reason or another have not previously&#13;
         (or have only partly) been put into effect. Even late in life, when such labours wearied him, his feelings were clear. On&#13;
         30 October 1967 he wrote to Joy Hill at George Allen &amp; Unwin, concerning a reader’s query he had received about points in&#13;
         the Appendices to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>: ‘Personally I have ceased to bother about these minor “discrepancies”, since if the genealogies and calendars etc. lack&#13;
         verisimilitude it is in their general excessive accuracy: &#13;
         <a id="pagexxii"/>as compared with real annals or genealogies! Anyway the slips were few, have now mostly been removed, and the discovery of&#13;
         what remain seems an amusing pastime! <em>But errors in the text are another matter</em>’ (italics ours). In fact Tolkien had not ‘ceased to bother’, and ‘slips’ were dealt with as opportunities arose. These, and&#13;
         the indulgence of his publisher, allowed Tolkien a luxury few authors enjoy: multiple chances not only to correct his text&#13;
         but to improve it, and to further develop the languages, geography, and peoples of Middle-earth.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The fiftieth anniversary of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> seemed an ideal opportunity to consider the latest (2002) text in light of information we had gathered in the course of decades&#13;
         of work in Tolkien studies, with Steve Frisby’s research at hand, and with an electronic copy of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> (supplied by HarperCollins) searchable by keyword or phrase. The latter especially allowed us to develop lists of words that&#13;
         varied from one instance to another, and investigate variations in usage, as they stood in the copy-text and relative to earlier&#13;
         editions and printings. Of course Tolkien wrote <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> over so long a period of time, some eighteen years, that inconsistencies in its text were almost inevitable. Christopher&#13;
         Tolkien even observed to us that some apparent inconsistencies of form in his father’s work may even have been deliberate:&#13;
         for instance, although Tolkien carefully distinguished <em>house</em> ‘dwelling’ from <em>House</em> ‘noble family or dynasty’, in two instances he used <em>house</em> in the latter sense but in lower case, perhaps because a capital letter would have detracted from the importance of the adjective&#13;
         with which the word was paired (‘royal house’, ‘golden house’). There can be no doubt, however, that Tolkien attempted to&#13;
         correct inconsistency, no less than outright error, whenever it came to his attention, and it was our opinion, with the advice&#13;
         and agreement of Christopher Tolkien, that an attempt should be made to do so in the anniversary edition, in so far as we&#13;
         could carefully and conservatively distinguish what to emend.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Many of the emendations in the present text are to marks &#13;
         <a id="pagexxiii"/>of punctuation, either to correct recent typographical errors or to repair surviving alterations introduced in the second&#13;
         printing of <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em>. In the latter respect and in every case, Tolkien’s original punctuation is always more felicitous – subtle points, when&#13;
         one is comparing commas and semi-colons, but no less a part of the author’s intended expression. Distinctive words such as&#13;
         <em>chill</em> rather than <em>cold</em>, and <em>glistered</em> rather than <em>glistened</em>, changed by typesetters long ago without authorization, likewise have been restored. A controlled amount of regularization&#13;
         also seemed called for, such as <em>naught</em> rather than <em>nought</em>, a change instituted by Tolkien but not carried through in all instances; <em>Dark Power</em> rather than <em>dark power</em> when the reference is obviously to Sauron (or Morgoth); <em>Barrow-downs</em> by Tolkien’s preference rather than <em>Barrowdowns</em>; likewise <em>Bree-hill</em> rather than <em>Bree Hill</em>; accented and more common <em>Drúadan</em> rather than <em>Druadan</em>; capitalized names of seasons when used as personification or metaphor, according to Tolkien’s predominant practice and the&#13;
         internal logic of the text; and <em>Elvish</em> rather than <em>elvish</em> when used as a separate adjective, following a preference Tolkien marked in his copy of the second edition of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. In addition, we have added a second accent to <em>Númenórean(s)</em>, as Tolkien often wrote the name in manuscript and as it appears in <em>The Silmarillion</em> and other posthumous publications.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The result, nonetheless, still includes many variations in capitalization, punctuation, and other points of style. Not all&#13;
         of these are erroneous: they include words such as <em>Sun</em>, <em>Moon</em>, <em>Hobbit</em>, and <em>Man</em> (or <em>sun</em>, <em>moon</em>, <em>hobbit</em>, <em>man</em>), which may change form according to meaning or application, in relation to adjacent adjectives, or whether Tolkien intended&#13;
         personification, poetry, or emphasis. His intent cannot be divined with confidence in every case. But it is possible to discern&#13;
         Tolkien’s preferences in many instances, from statements he wrote in his check copies of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> or from a close analysis of its text in manuscript, typescript, proof, and print. Whenever there has been any doubt whatsoever&#13;
         as to &#13;
         <a id="pagexxiv"/>the author’s intentions, the text has been allowed to stand.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Most of the demonstrable errors noted by Christopher Tolkien in <em>The History of Middle-earth</em> also have been corrected, such as the distance from the Brandywine Bridge to the Ferry ( <em>ten</em> miles rather than <em>twenty</em>) and the number of Merry’s ponies ( <em>five</em> rather than <em>six</em>), shadows of earlier drafts. But those inconsistencies of content, such as Gimli’s famous (and erroneous) statement in Book&#13;
         III, Chapter 7, ‘Till now I have hewn naught but wood since I left Moria’, which would require rewriting to emend rather than&#13;
         simple correction, remain unchanged.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>So many new emendations to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and such an extensive review of its text, deserve to be fully documented. Although most readers will be content with the&#13;
         text alone, many will want to know more about the problems encountered in preparing this new edition, and their solutions&#13;
         (where solutions have been possible), especially where the text has been emended, but also where it has not. To this end,&#13;
         and to illuminate the work in other respects, we are preparing a volume of annotations to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> for publication in 2005. This will allow us to discuss, at a length impossible in a prefatory note, the various textual cruces&#13;
         of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, to identify changes that have been made to the present text, and to remark on significant alterations to the published work&#13;
         throughout its history. We will also explain archaic or unusual words and names in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, explore literary and historical influences, note connections with Tolkien’s other writings, and comment on differences between&#13;
         its drafts and published form, on questions of language, and on much else that we hope will interest readers and enhance their&#13;
         enjoyment of Tolkien’s masterpiece.&#13;

            FOREWORD TO THE SECOND EDITION</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="p1">This tale grew in the telling, until it became a history of the Great War of the Ring and included many glimpses of the yet&#13;
         more ancient history that preceded it. It was begun soon after <em>The Hobbit</em> was written and before its publication in 1937; but I did not go on with this sequel, for I wished first to complete and&#13;
         set in order the mythology and legends of the Elder Days, which had then been taking shape for some years. I desired to do&#13;
         this for my own satisfaction, and I had little hope that other people would be interested in this work, especially since it&#13;
         was primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary background of ‘history’ for Elvish&#13;
         tongues.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected <em>little hope</em> to <em>no hope</em>, I went back to the sequel, encouraged by requests from readers for more information concerning hobbits and their adventures.&#13;
         But the story was drawn irresistibly towards the older world, and became an account, as it were, of its end and passing away&#13;
         before its beginning and middle had been told. The process had begun in the writing of <em>The Hobbit</em>, in which there were already some references to the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the High-elves, and the orcs, as well&#13;
         as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of things higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin, Moria, Gandalf, the Necromancer,&#13;
         the Ring. The discovery of the significance of these glimpses and of their relation to the ancient histories revealed the&#13;
         Third Age and its culmination in the War of the Ring.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it, but they had to wait a long time; for the composition&#13;
         of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> went on at intervals during the years 1936 to 1949, a period in which I had many duties that I did not neglect, and many&#13;
         other interests as a learner and teacher that often absorbed me. The delay was, &#13;
         <a id="pagexxvi"/>of course, also increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which year the tale had not yet reached the end of&#13;
         Book One. In spite of the darkness of the next five years I found that the story could not now be wholly abandoned, and I&#13;
         plodded on, mostly by night, till I stood by Balin’s tomb in Moria. There I halted for a long while. It was almost a year&#13;
         later when I went on and so came to Lothlórien and the Great River late in 1941. In the next year I wrote the first drafts&#13;
         of the matter that now stands as Book Three, and the beginnings of chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as the beacons&#13;
         flared in Anórien and Théoden came to Harrowdale I stopped. Foresight had failed and there was no time for thought.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was during 1944 that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a war which it was my task to conduct, or at least to&#13;
         report, I forced myself to tackle the journey of Frodo to Mordor. These chapters, eventually to become Book Four, were written&#13;
         and sent out as a serial to my son, Christopher, then in South Africa with the RAF. Nonetheless it took another five years&#13;
         before the tale was brought to its present end; in that time I changed my house, my chair, and my college, and the days though&#13;
         less dark were no less laborious. Then when the ‘end’ had at last been reached the whole story had to be revised, and indeed&#13;
         largely re-written backwards. And it had to be typed, and re-typed: by me; the cost of professional typing by the ten-fingered&#13;
         was beyond my means.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>The Lord of the Rings</em> has been read by many people since it finally appeared in print; and I should like to say something here with reference to&#13;
         the many opinions or guesses that I have received or have read concerning the motives and meaning of the tale. The prime motive&#13;
         was the desire of a tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them,&#13;
         delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is appealing&#13;
         or moving, and for many the guide was inevitably often at fault. Some who &#13;
         <a id="pagexxvii"/>have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to&#13;
         complain, since I have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer. But even from&#13;
         the points of view of many who have enjoyed my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible in a long&#13;
         tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at the same points; for I find from the letters that I&#13;
         have received that the passages or chapters that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approved. The most critical&#13;
         reader of all, myself, now finds many defects, minor and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either to review&#13;
         the book or to write it again, he will pass over these in silence, except one that has been noted by others: the book is too&#13;
         short.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As for any inner meaning or ‘message’, it has in the intention of the author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical.&#13;
         As the story grew it put down roots (into the past) and threw out unexpected branches: but its main theme was settled from&#13;
         the outset by the inevitable choice of the Ring as the link between it and <em>The Hobbit</em>. The crucial chapter, ‘The Shadow of the Past’, is one of the oldest parts of the tale. It was written long before the foreshadow&#13;
         of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable disaster, and from that point the story would have developed along essentially&#13;
         the same lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before in mind, or in some cases already written,&#13;
         and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that began in 1939 or its sequels.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusion. If it had inspired or directed the development&#13;
         of the legend, then certainly the Ring would have been seized and used against Sauron; he would not have been annihilated&#13;
         but enslaved, and Barad-dûr would not have been destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get possession of the Ring, would&#13;
         in the confusion and treacheries of the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his &#13;
         <a id="pagexxviii"/>own researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would have made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge the self-styled&#13;
         Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt: they would not long have&#13;
         survived even as slaves.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those who like allegory or topical reference. But&#13;
         I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect&#13;
         its presence. I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers.&#13;
         I think that many confuse ‘applicability’ with ‘allegory’; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other&#13;
         in the purposed domination of the author.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his experience, but the ways in which a story-germ uses the soil of&#13;
         experience are extremely complex, and attempts to define the process are at best guesses from evidence that is inadequate&#13;
         and ambiguous. It is also false, though naturally attractive, when the lives of an author and critic have overlapped, to suppose&#13;
         that the movements of thought or the events of times common to both were necessarily the most powerful influences. One has&#13;
         indeed personally to come under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as the years go by it seems now often&#13;
         forgotten that to be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to be involved in 1939 and the following&#13;
         years. By 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead. Or to take a less grievous matter: it has been supposed by some&#13;
         that ‘The Scouring of the Shire’ reflects the situation in England at the time when I was finishing my tale. It does not.&#13;
         It is an essential part of the plot, foreseen from the outset, though in the event modified by the character of Saruman as&#13;
         developed in the story without, need I say, any allegorical significance or contemporary political reference whatsoever. It&#13;
         has indeed some basis in experience, though slender (for the economic situation was entirely different), and much further&#13;
         back. The &#13;
         <a id="pagexxix"/>country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten, in days when motor-cars were rare objects&#13;
         (I had never seen one) and men were still building suburban railways. Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last decrepitude&#13;
         of the once thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so important. I never liked the looks of the Young&#13;
         miller, but his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is now issued in a new edition, and the opportunity has been taken of revising it. A number of errors and inconsistencies&#13;
         that still remained in the text have been corrected, and an attempt has been made to provide information on a few points which&#13;
         attentive readers have raised. I have considered all their comments and enquiries, and if some seem to have been passed over&#13;
         that may be because I have failed to keep my notes in order; but many enquiries could only be answered by additional appendices,&#13;
         or indeed by the production of an accessory volume containing much of the material that I did not include in the original&#13;
         edition, in particular more detailed linguistic information. In the meantime this edition offers this Foreword, an addition&#13;
         to the Prologue, some notes, and an index of the names of persons and places. This index is in intention complete in items&#13;
         but not in references, since for the present purpose it has been necessary to reduce its bulk. A complete index, making full&#13;
         use of the material prepared for me by Mrs. N. Smith, belongs rather to the accessory volume.&#13;

            PROLOGUE</a></p>&#13;
      <h1>1 <em>Concerning Hobbits</em></h1>&#13;
      <p class="p1">This book is largely concerned with Hobbits, and from its pages a reader may discover much of their character and a little&#13;
         of their history. Further information will also be found in the selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has already&#13;
         been published, under the title of <em>The Hobbit</em>. That story was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book, composed by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become&#13;
         famous in the world at large, and called by him <em>There and Back Again</em>, since they told of his journey into the East and his return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits in the great&#13;
         events of that Age that are here related.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Many, however, may wish to know more about this remarkable people from the outset, while some may not possess the earlier&#13;
         book. For such readers a few notes on the more important points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and the first adventure&#13;
         is briefly recalled.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet&#13;
         and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not and did not understand&#13;
         or like machines more complicated than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though they were skilful with tools.&#13;
         Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of ‘the Big Folk’, as they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are&#13;
         becoming hard to find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily,&#13;
         they are nonetheless nimble and deft in their movements. They &#13;
         <a id="page2"/>possessed from the first the art of disappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come&#13;
         blundering by; and this art they have developed until to Men it may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied&#13;
         magic of any kind, and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity and practice, and a close friendship&#13;
         with the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less stout and stocky, that is, even when they are not actually much shorter.&#13;
         Their height is variable, ranging between two and four feet of our measure. They seldom now reach three feet; but they have&#13;
         dwindled, they say, and in ancient days they were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), son of Isumbras&#13;
         the Third, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. He was surpassed in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters&#13;
         of old; but that curious matter is dealt with in this book.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are concerned, in the days of their peace and prosperity they were&#13;
         a merry folk. They dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green; but they seldom wore shoes, since their&#13;
         feet had tough leathery soles and were clad in a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was commonly&#13;
         brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make&#13;
         many other useful and comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked,&#13;
         with mouths apt to laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and drink, often and heartily, being&#13;
         fond of simple jests at all times, and of six meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable and delighted in&#13;
         parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and eagerly accepted.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even&#13;
         than Dwarves. Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after their &#13;
         <a id="page3"/>own fashion, and liked and disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship is can no longer be&#13;
         discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in the Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves still&#13;
         preserve any records of that vanished time, and their traditions are concerned almost entirely with their own history, in&#13;
         which Men appear seldom and Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in fact, lived quietly in&#13;
         Middle-earth for many long years before other folk became even aware of them. And the world being after all full of strange&#13;
         creatures beyond count, these little people seemed of very little importance. But in the days of Bilbo, and of Frodo his heir,&#13;
         they suddenly became, by no wish of their own, both important and renowned, and troubled the counsels of the Wise and the&#13;
         Great.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Those days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long past, and the shape of all lands has been changed; but the regions&#13;
         in which Hobbits then lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger: the North-West of the Old World,&#13;
         east of the Sea. Of their original home the Hobbits in Bilbo’s time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other than&#13;
         genealogical lore) was far from general among them, but there remained still a few in the older families who studied their&#13;
         own books, and even gathered reports of old times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Their own records began&#13;
         only after the settlement of the Shire, and their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their Wandering Days.&#13;
         It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of their peculiar words and customs, that like many other&#13;
         folk Hobbits had in the distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper&#13;
         vales of Anduin, between the eaves of Greenwood the Great and the Misty Mountains. Why they later undertook the hard and perilous&#13;
         crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer certain. Their own accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land,&#13;
         and of &#13;
         <a id="page4"/>a shadow that fell on the forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was Mirkwood.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already become divided into three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots,&#13;
         Stoors, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner of skin, smaller, and shorter, and they were beardless and bootless; their&#13;
         hands and feet were neat and nimble; and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier in build;&#13;
         their feet and hands were larger; and they preferred flat lands and riversides. The Fallohides were fairer of skin and also&#13;
         of hair, and they were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and long lived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved westward&#13;
         early, and roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the others were still in Wilderland. They were the most normal and&#13;
         representative variety of Hobbit, and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to settle in one place, and longest&#13;
         preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin, and were less shy of Men. They came west after the Harfoots&#13;
         and followed the course of the Loudwater southwards; and there many of them long dwelt between Tharbad and the borders of&#13;
         Dunland before they moved north again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were more friendly with Elves than the other Hobbits were,&#13;
         and had more skill in language and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to tilling. They crossed the&#13;
         mountains north of Rivendell and came down the River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had&#13;
         preceded them, but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were often found as leaders or chieftains among clans&#13;
         of Harfoots or Stoors. Even in Bilbo’s time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the greater families,&#13;
         such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page5"/>In the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains and the Mountains of Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and Elves.&#13;
         Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there of the Dúnedain, the kings of Men that came over the Sea out of Westernesse; but they&#13;
         were dwindling fast and the lands of their North Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was room and to spare&#13;
         for incomers, and ere long the Hobbits began to settle in ordered communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long&#13;
         disappeared and been forgotten in Bilbo’s time; but one of the first to become important still endured, though reduced in&#13;
         size; this was at Bree and in the Chetwood that lay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their letters and began to write after the manner of the Dúnedain,&#13;
         who had in their turn long before learned the art from the Elves. And in those days also they forgot whatever languages they&#13;
         had used before, and spoke ever after the Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was current through all the lands&#13;
         of the kings from Arnor to Gondor, and about all the coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to Lune. Yet they kept a few words of&#13;
         their own, as well as their own names of months and days, and a great store of personal names out of the past.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>About this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes history with a reckoning of years. For it was in the one thousand six&#13;
         hundred and first year of the Third Age that the Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set out from Bree; and having obtained&#13;
         permission from the high king at Fornost,&#13;
         <sup>&#13;
            <a href="Fellowshipofth_foot-1.html#footnote_number_1">*</a>&#13;
         </sup>&#13;
         <a id="footnote_reference_1"/> they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a great following of Hobbits. They passed over the Bridge of Stonebows, that&#13;
         had been built in the days of the power of the North Kingdom, and they took all the land beyond to dwell in, between the river&#13;
         and the Far Downs. All that was &#13;
         <a id="page6"/>demanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge in repair, and all other bridges and roads, speed the king’s messengers,&#13;
         and acknowledge his lordship.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Thus began the <em>Shire-reckoning</em>, for the year of the crossing of the Brandywine (as the Hobbits turned the name) became Year One of the Shire, and all later&#13;
         dates were reckoned from it.&#13;
         <sup>&#13;
            <a href="Fellowshipofth_foot-1.html#footnote_number_2">*</a>&#13;
         </sup>&#13;
         <a id="footnote_reference_2"/> At once the western Hobbits fell in love with their new land, and they remained there, and soon passed once more out of the&#13;
         history of Men and of Elves. While there was still a king they were in name his subjects, but they were, in fact, ruled by&#13;
         their own chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To the last battle at Fornost with the Witch-lord&#13;
         of Angmar they sent some bowmen to the aid of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men record it. But in that&#13;
         war the North Kingdom ended; and then the Hobbits took the land for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs a Thain&#13;
         to hold the authority of the king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were little troubled by wars, and they prospered&#13;
         and multiplied after the Dark Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the Long Winter and the famine that followed it. Many&#13;
         thousands then perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158–60) were at the time of this tale long past and the Hobbits had again&#13;
         become accustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and though it had long been deserted when they entered it, it had&#13;
         before been well tilled, and there the king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the Brandywine Bridge, and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in&#13;
         the south. The Hobbits named it the Shire, as the region of the authority of their Thain, and a district of well-ordered business;&#13;
         and there in that pleasant corner of the world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and &#13;
         <a id="page7"/>they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty were the&#13;
         rule in Middle-earth and the right of all sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the Guardians,&#13;
         and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of the Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased&#13;
         to remember it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they had never fought among themselves. In olden days they had, of course,&#13;
         been often obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world; but in Bilbo’s time that was very ancient history. The&#13;
         last battle, before this story opens, and indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the Shire, was&#13;
         beyond living memory: the Battle of Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in which Bandobras Took routed an invasion of Orcs. Even the weathers&#13;
         had grown milder, and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in bitter white winters were now only a grandfather’s&#13;
         tale. So, though there was still some store of weapons in the Shire, these were used mostly as trophies, hanging above hearths&#13;
         or on walls, or gathered into the museum at Michel Delving. The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Hobbits had&#13;
         no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away, they called a <em>mathom</em>. Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms, and many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were&#13;
         of that sort.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or&#13;
         to kill; and they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could, when put to it, do without&#13;
         them, and could survive rough handling by grief, foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well&#13;
         and looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces. Though slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that&#13;
         lived, they were doughty at bay, and at need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, for they were keen-eyed&#13;
         and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and &#13;
         <a id="page8"/>arrows. If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, it was well to get quickly under cover, as all trespassing beasts knew very well.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or so they believed, and in such dwellings they still felt most at&#13;
         home; but in the course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode. Actually in the Shire in Bilbo’s days&#13;
         it was, as a rule, only the richest and the poorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on living in&#13;
         burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one window or none; while the well-to-do still constructed&#13;
         more luxurious versions of the simple diggings of old. But suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels (or <em>smials</em> as they called them) were not everywhere to be found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as they multiplied,&#13;
         began to build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly regions and the older villages, such as Hobbiton or Tuckborough, or&#13;
         in the chief township of the Shire, Michel Delving on the White Downs, there were now many houses of wood, brick, or stone.&#13;
         These were specially favoured by millers, smiths, ropers, and cartwrights, and others of that sort; for even when they had&#13;
         holes to live in, Hobbits had long been accustomed to build sheds and workshops.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among the inhabitants of the Marish down by the Brandywine.&#13;
         The Hobbits of that quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore dwarf-boots in muddy weather.&#13;
         But they were well known to be Stoors in a large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on their&#13;
         chins. No Harfoot or Fallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the folk of the Marish, and of Buckland, east of the River,&#13;
         which they afterwards occupied, came for the most part later into the Shire up from south-away; and they still had many peculiar&#13;
         names and strange words not found elsewhere in the Shire.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, was derived from the Dúnedain. But the Hobbits may&#13;
         have learned it direct from the Elves, the teachers of Men in &#13;
         <a id="page9"/>their youth. For the Elves of the High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that time at the&#13;
         Grey Havens away to the west, and in other places within reach of the Shire. Three Elf-towers of immemorial age were still&#13;
         to be seen on the Tower Hills beyond the western marches. They shone far off in the moonlight. The tallest was furthest away,&#13;
         standing alone upon a green mound. The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the top of that tower;&#13;
         but no Hobbit had ever been known to climb it. Indeed, few Hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had&#13;
         ever returned to report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats with deep misgivings, and not many of them could&#13;
         swim. And as the days of the Shire lengthened they spoke less and less with the Elves, and grew afraid of them, and distrustful&#13;
         of those that had dealings with them; and the Sea became a word of fear among them, and a token of death, and they turned&#13;
         their faces away from the hills in the west.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The craft of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits used it in their own fashion. They did not go in for&#13;
         towers. Their houses were usually long, low, and comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no more than built imitations&#13;
         of <em>smials</em>, thatched with dry grass or straw, or roofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, belonged&#13;
         to the early days of the Shire, and hobbit-building had long since been altered, improved by devices, learned from Dwarves,&#13;
         or discovered by themselves. A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was the chief remaining peculiarity of&#13;
         hobbit-architecture.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large, and inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were&#13;
         as bachelors very exceptional, as they were also in many other ways, such as their friendship with the Elves.) Sometimes,&#13;
         as in the case of the Tooks of Great Smials, or the Brandybucks of Brandy Hall, many generations of relatives lived in (comparative)&#13;
         peace together in one ancestral and many-tunnelled mansion. All Hobbits were, in any case, &#13;
         <a id="page10"/>clannish and reckoned up their relationships with great care. They drew long and elaborate family-trees with innumerable branches.&#13;
         In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related to whom, and in what degree. It would be impossible in&#13;
         this book to set out a family-tree that included even the more important members of the more important families at the time&#13;
         which these tales tell of. The genealogical trees at the end of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small book in themselves,&#13;
         and all but Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull. Hobbits delighted in such things, if they were accurate: they liked&#13;
         to have books filled with things that they already knew, set out fair and square with no contradictions.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <h1>2 <em>Concerning Pipe-weed</em></h1>&#13;
      <p class="p1">There is another astonishing thing about Hobbits of old that must be mentioned, an astonishing habit: they imbibed or inhaled,&#13;
         through pipes of clay or wood, the smoke of the burning leaves of a herb, which they called <em>pipe-weed</em> or <em>leaf</em>, a variety probably of <em>Nicotiana</em>. A great deal of mystery surrounds the origin of this peculiar custom, or ‘art’ as the Hobbits preferred to call it. All&#13;
         that could be discovered about it in antiquity was put together by Meriadoc Brandybuck (later Master of Buckland), and since&#13;
         he and the tobacco of the Southfarthing play a part in the history that follows, his remarks in the introduction to his <em>Herblore of the Shire</em> may be quoted.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘This,’ he says, ‘is the one art that we can certainly claim to be our own invention. When Hobbits first began to smoke is&#13;
         not known, all the legends and family histories take it for granted; for ages folk in the Shire smoked various herbs, some&#13;
         fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that Tobold Hornblower of Longbottom in the Southfarthing first grew the true&#13;
         pipe-weed in his gardens in the days of Isengrim the Second, about the year 1070 of Shire-reckoning. The best &#13;
         <a id="page11"/>home-grown still comes from that district, especially the varieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and Southern Star.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying day he would not tell. He knew much about herbs, but he&#13;
         was no traveller. It is said that in his youth he went often to Bree, though he certainly never went further from the Shire&#13;
         than that. It is thus quite possible that he learned of this plant in Bree, where now, at any rate, it grows well on the south&#13;
         slopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbits claim to have been the first actual smokers of the pipe-weed. They claim, of course,&#13;
         to have done everything before the people of the Shire, whom they refer to as “colonists”; but in this case their claim is,&#13;
         I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was from Bree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent centuries&#13;
         among Dwarves and such other folk, Rangers, Wizards, or wanderers, as still passed to and fro through that ancient road-meeting.&#13;
         The home and centre of the art is thus to be found in the old inn of Bree, <em>The Prancing Pony</em>, that has been kept by the family of Butterbur from time beyond record.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All the same, observations that I have made on my own many journeys south have convinced me that the weed itself is not native&#13;
         to our parts of the world, but came northward from the lower Anduin, whither it was, I suspect, originally brought over Sea&#13;
         by the Men of Westernesse. It grows abundantly in Gondor, and there is richer and larger than in the North, where it is never&#13;
         found wild, and flourishes only in warm sheltered places like Longbottom. The Men of Gondor call it <em>sweet galenas</em>, and esteem it only for the fragrance of its flowers. From that land it must have been carried up the Greenway during the&#13;
         long centuries between the coming of Elendil and our own days. But even the Dúnedain of Gondor allow us this credit: Hobbits&#13;
         first put it into pipes. Not even the Wizards first thought of that before we did. Though one Wizard that I knew took up the&#13;
         art long ago, and became as skilful in it as in all other things that he put his mind to.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page12"/>&#13;
      <h1>3 <em>Of the Ordering of the Shire</em></h1>&#13;
      <p class="p1">The Shire was divided into four quarters, the Farthings already referred to, North, South, East, and West; and these again&#13;
         each into a number of folklands, which still bore the names of some of the old leading families, although by the time of this&#13;
         history these names were no longer found only in their proper folklands. Nearly all Tooks still lived in the Tookland, but&#13;
         that was not true of many other families, such as the Bagginses or the Boffins. Outside the Farthings were the East and West&#13;
         Marches: the Buckland (p. <a href="Fellowshipofth_chap-5.html#page129" id="prl">129</a>); and the Westmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1452.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Shire at this time had hardly any ‘government’. Families for the most part managed their own affairs. Growing food and&#13;
         eating it occupied most of their time. In other matters they were, as a rule, generous and not greedy, but contented and moderate,&#13;
         so that estates, farms, workshops, and small trades tended to remain unchanged for generations.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There remained, of course, the ancient tradition concerning the high king at Fornost, or Norbury as they called it, away north&#13;
         of the Shire. But there had been no king for nearly a thousand years, and even the ruins of Kings’ Norbury were covered with&#13;
         grass. Yet the Hobbits still said of wild folk and wicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the king. For&#13;
         they attributed to the king of old all their essential laws; and usually they kept the laws of free will, because they were&#13;
         The Rules (as they said), both ancient and just.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It is true that the Took family had long been pre-eminent; for the office of Thain had passed to them (from the Old-bucks)&#13;
         some centuries before, and the chief Took had borne that title ever since. The Thain was the master of the Shire-moot, and&#13;
         captain of the Shire-muster and the Hobbitry-in-arms; but as muster and moot were only held in times of emergency, which no&#13;
         longer occurred, the Thainship had ceased to be more than a nominal dignity. The Took family &#13;
         <a id="page13"/>was still, indeed, accorded a special respect, for it remained both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and was liable to produce&#13;
         in every generation strong characters of peculiar habits and even adventurous temperament. The latter qualities, however,&#13;
         were now rather tolerated (in the rich) than generally approved. The custom endured, nonetheless, of referring to the head&#13;
         of the family as The Took, and of adding to his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim the Second, for instance.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The only real official in the Shire at this date was the Mayor of Michel Delving (or of the Shire), who was elected every&#13;
         seven years at the Free Fair on the White Downs at the Lithe, that is at Midsummer. As mayor almost his only duty was to preside&#13;
         at banquets, given on the Shire-holidays, which occurred at frequent intervals. But the offices of Postmaster and First Shirriff&#13;
         were attached to the mayoralty, so that he managed both the Messenger Service and the Watch. These were the only Shire-services,&#13;
         and the Messengers were the most numerous, and much the busier of the two. By no means all Hobbits were lettered, but those&#13;
         who were wrote constantly to all their friends (and a selection of their relations) who lived further off than an afternoon’s&#13;
         walk.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their police, or the nearest equivalent that they possessed. They had,&#13;
         of course, no uniforms (such things being quite unknown), only a feather in their caps; and they were in practice rather haywards&#13;
         than policemen, more concerned with the strayings of beasts than of people. There were in all the Shire only twelve of them,&#13;
         three in each Farthing, for Inside Work. A rather larger body, varying at need, was employed to ‘beat the bounds’, and to&#13;
         see that Outsiders of any kind, great or small, did not make themselves a nuisance.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At the time when this story begins the Bounders, as they were called, had been greatly increased. There were many reports&#13;
         and complaints of strange persons and creatures prowling about the borders, or over them: the first sign that all was not&#13;
         quite as it should be, and always had been except &#13;
         <a id="page14"/>in tales and legends of long ago. Few heeded the sign, and not even Bilbo yet had any notion of what it portended. Sixty years&#13;
         had passed since he set out on his memorable journey, and he was old even for Hobbits, who reached a hundred as often as not;&#13;
         but much evidently still remained of the considerable wealth that he had brought back. How much or how little he revealed&#13;
         to no one, not even to Frodo his favourite ‘nephew’. And he still kept secret the ring that he had found.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <h1>4 <em>Of the Finding of the Ring</em></h1>&#13;
      <p class="p1">As is told in <em>The Hobbit</em>, there came one day to Bilbo’s door the great Wizard, Gandalf the Grey, and thirteen dwarves with him: none other, indeed,&#13;
         than Thorin Oakenshield, descendant of kings, and his twelve companions in exile. With them he set out, to his own lasting&#13;
         astonishment, on a morning of April, it being then the year 1341 Shire-reckoning, on a quest of great treasure, the dwarf-hoards&#13;
         of the Kings under the Mountain, beneath Erebor in Dale, far off in the East. The quest was successful, and the Dragon that&#13;
         guarded the hoard was destroyed. Yet, though before all was won the Battle of Five Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain,&#13;
         and many deeds of renown were done, the matter would scarcely have concerned later history, or earned more than a note in&#13;
         the long annals of the Third Age, but for an ‘accident’ by the way. The party was assailed by Orcs in a high pass of the Misty&#13;
         Mountains as they went towards Wilderland; and so it happened that Bilbo was lost for a while in the black orc-mines deep&#13;
         under the mountains, and there, as he groped in vain in the dark, he put his hand on a ring, lying on the floor of a tunnel.&#13;
         He put it in his pocket. It seemed then like mere luck.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Trying to find his way out, Bilbo went on down to the roots of the mountains, until he could go no further. At the &#13;
         <a id="page15"/>bottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light, and on an island of rock in the water lived Gollum. He was a loathsome&#13;
         little creature: he paddled a small boat with his large flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes and catching blind fish&#13;
         with his long fingers, and eating them raw. He ate any living thing, even orc, if he could catch it and strangle it without&#13;
         a struggle. He possessed a secret treasure that had come to him long ages ago, when he still lived in the light: a ring of&#13;
         gold that made its wearer invisible. It was the one thing he loved, his ‘Precious’, and he talked to it, even when it was&#13;
         not with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on his island, except when he was hunting or spying on the orcs of the&#13;
         mines.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Maybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring had been on him when they met; but it was not, and the hobbit held&#13;
         in his hand an Elvish knife, which served him as a sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo to the Riddle-game, saying&#13;
         that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo could not guess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if Bilbo defeated him, then&#13;
         he would do as Bilbo wished: he would lead him to a way out of the tunnels.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither go on nor back, Bilbo accepted the challenge; and they asked&#13;
         one another many riddles. In the end Bilbo won the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for he was stumped at last&#13;
         for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his hand came upon the ring he had picked up and forgotten: <em>What have I got in my pocket?</em> This Gollum failed to answer, though he demanded three guesses.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Authorities, it is true, differ whether this last question was a mere ‘question’ and not a ‘riddle’ according to the strict&#13;
         rules of the Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and trying to guess the answer, Gollum was bound by his promise.&#13;
         And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word; for the thought came to him that this slimy creature might prove false, even though&#13;
         such promises were held sacred, and of old all but the wickedest things feared to break them. But &#13;
         <a id="page16"/>after ages alone in the dark Gollum’s heart was black, and treachery was in it. He slipped away, and returned to his island,&#13;
         of which Bilbo knew nothing, not far off in the dark water. There, he thought, lay his ring. He was hungry now, and angry,&#13;
         and once his ‘Precious’ was with him he would not fear any weapon at all.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But the ring was not on the island; he had lost it, it was gone. His screech sent a shiver down Bilbo’s back, though he did&#13;
         not yet understand what had happened. But Gollum had at last leaped to a guess, too late. <em>What has it got in its pocketses?</em> he cried. The light in his eyes was like a green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and recover his ‘Precious’. Just&#13;
         in time Bilbo saw his peril, and he fled blindly up the passage away from the water; and once more he was saved by his luck.&#13;
         For as he ran he put his hand in his pocket, and the ring slipped quietly on to his finger. So it was that Gollum passed him&#13;
         without seeing him, and went to guard the way out, lest the ‘thief ’ should escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, as he went&#13;
         along, cursing, and talking to himself about his ‘Precious’; from which talk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth, and hope&#13;
         came to him in the darkness: he himself had found the marvellous ring and a chance of escape from the orcs and from Gollum.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the lower gates of the mines, on the eastward side of the&#13;
         mountains. There Gollum crouched at bay, smelling and listening; and Bilbo was tempted to slay him with his sword. But pity&#13;
         stayed him, and though he kept the ring, in which his only hope lay, he would not use it to help him kill the wretched creature&#13;
         at a disadvantage. In the end, gathering his courage, he leaped over Gollum in the dark, and fled away down the passage, pursued&#13;
         by his enemy’s cries of hate and despair: <em>Thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it for ever!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told it to his companions. To them his account was that&#13;
         Gollum had promised to give him a <em>present</em>, if he won the &#13;
         <a id="page17"/>game; but when Gollum went to fetch it from his island he found the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been given&#13;
         to him long ago on his birthday. Bilbo guessed that this was the very ring that he had found, and as he had won the game,&#13;
         it was already his by right. But being in a tight place, he said nothing about it, and made Gollum show him the way out, as&#13;
         a reward instead of a present. This account Bilbo set down in his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered it himself,&#13;
         not even after the Council of Elrond. Evidently it still appeared in the original Red Book, as it did in several of the copies&#13;
         and abstracts. But many copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derived no doubt from notes by Frodo or Samwise,&#13;
         both of whom learned the truth, though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually written by the old hobbit&#13;
         himself.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo’s first story, as soon as he heard it, and he continued to be very curious about the ring.&#13;
         Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning, which for a while strained their friendship; but the&#13;
         wizard seemed to think the truth important. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, and disturbing,&#13;
         to find that the good hobbit had not told the truth from the first: quite contrary to his habit. The idea of a ‘present’ was&#13;
         not mere hobbitlike invention, all the same. It was suggested to Bilbo, as he confessed, by Gollum’s talk that he overheard;&#13;
         for Gollum did, in fact, call the ring his ‘birthday-present’, many times. That also Gandalf thought strange and suspicious;&#13;
         but he did not discover the truth in this point for many more years, as will be seen in this book.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Of Bilbo’s later adventures little more need be said here. With the help of the ring he escaped from the orc-guards at the&#13;
         gate and rejoined his companions. He used the ring many times on his quest, chiefly for the help of his friends; but he kept&#13;
         it secret from them as long as he could. After his return to his home he never spoke of it again to anyone, save Gandalf &#13;
         <a id="page18"/>and Frodo; and no one else in the Shire knew of its existence, or so he believed. Only to Frodo did he show the account of&#13;
         his Journey that he was writing.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>His sword, Sting, Bilbo hung over his fireplace, and his coat of marvellous mail, the gift of the Dwarves from the Dragon-hoard,&#13;
         he lent to a museum, to the Michel Delving Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a drawer at Bag End the old cloak and hood&#13;
         that he had worn on his travels; and the ring, secured by a fine chain, remained in his pocket.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He returned to his home at Bag End on June the 22nd in his fifty-second year (S.R. 1342), and nothing very notable occurred&#13;
         in the Shire until Mr. Baggins began the preparations for the celebration of his hundred-and-eleventh birthday (S.R. 1401).&#13;
         At this point this History begins.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <h1><strong><small>NOTE ON THE SHIRE RECORDS</small></strong></h1>&#13;
      <p class="p1">At the end of the Third Age the part played by the Hobbits in the great events that led to the inclusion of the Shire in the&#13;
         Reunited Kingdom awakened among them a more widespread interest in their own history; and many of their traditions, up to&#13;
         that time still mainly oral, were collected and written down. The greater families were also concerned with events in the&#13;
         Kingdom at large, and many of their members studied its ancient histories and legends. By the end of the first century of&#13;
         the Fourth Age there were already to be found in the Shire several libraries that contained many historical books and records.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The largest of these collections were probably at Under-towers, at Great Smials, and at Brandy Hall. This account of the end&#13;
         of the Third Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book of Westmarch. That most important source for the history of the War of&#13;
         the Ring was so called because it was long preserved at Undertowers, the home of the Fairbairns, &#13;
         <a id="page19"/>Wardens of the Westmarch.&#13;
         <sup>&#13;
            <a href="Fellowshipofth_foot-1.html#footnote_number_3">*</a>&#13;
         </sup>&#13;
         <a id="footnote_reference_3"/> It was in origin Bilbo’s private diary, which he took with him to Rivendell. Frodo brought it back to the Shire, together&#13;
         with many loose leaves of notes, and during S.R. 1420–1 he nearly filled its pages with his account of the War. But annexed&#13;
         to it and preserved with it, probably in a single red case, were the three large volumes, bound in red leather, that Bilbo&#13;
         gave to him as a parting gift. To these four volumes there was added in Westmarch a fifth containing commentaries, genealogies,&#13;
         and various other matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The original Red Book has not been preserved, but many copies were made, especially of the first volume, for the use of the&#13;
         descendants of the children of Master Samwise. The most important copy, however, has a different history. It was kept at Great&#13;
         Smials, but it was written in Gondor, probably at the request of the great-grandson of Peregrin, and completed in S.R. 1592&#13;
         (F.A. 172). Its southern scribe appended this note: Findegil, King’s Writer, finished this work in IV 172. It is an exact&#13;
         copy in all details of the Thain’s Book in Minas Tirith. That book was a copy, made at the request of King Elessar, of the&#13;
         Red Book of the Periannath, and was brought to him by the Thain Peregrin when he retired to Gondor in IV 64.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Thain’s Book was thus the first copy made of the Red Book and contained much that was later omitted or lost. In Minas&#13;
         Tirith it received much annotation, and many corrections, especially of names, words, and quotations in the Elvish languages;&#13;
         and there was added to it an abbreviated version of those parts of <em>The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen</em> which lie outside the account of the War. The full tale is stated to have been written by Barahir, grandson of the Steward&#13;
         Faramir, some time after the passing of the King. But the chief importance of Findegil’s copy is that it alone contains the&#13;
         whole of Bilbo’s ‘Translations from the Elvish’. These three volumes &#13;
         <a id="page20"/>were found to be a work of great skill and learning in which, between 1403 and 1418, he had used all the sources available&#13;
         to him in Rivendell, both living and written. But since they were little used by Frodo, being almost entirely concerned with&#13;
         the Elder Days, no more is said of them here.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Since Meriadoc and Peregrin became the heads of their great families, and at the same time kept up their connexions with Rohan&#13;
         and Gondor, the libraries at Bucklebury and Tuckborough contained much that did not appear in the Red Book. In Brandy Hall&#13;
         there were many works dealing with Eriador and the history of Rohan. Some of these were composed or begun by Meriadoc himself,&#13;
         though in the Shire he was chiefly remembered for his <em>Herblore of the Shire</em>, and for his <em>Reckoning of Years</em> in which he discussed the relation of the calendars of the Shire and Bree to those of Rivendell, Gondor, and Rohan. He also&#13;
         wrote a short treatise on <em>Old Words and Names in the Shire</em>, showing special interest in discovering the kinship with the language of the Rohirrim of such ‘shire-words’ as <em>mathom</em> and old elements in place names.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At Great Smials the books were of less interest to Shire-folk, though more important for larger history. None of them was&#13;
         written by Peregrin, but he and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of Gondor: mainly copies or summaries&#13;
         of histories or legends relating to Elendil and his heirs. Only here in the Shire were to be found extensive materials for&#13;
         the history of Númenor and the arising of Sauron. It was probably at Great Smials that <em>The Tale of Years</em><sup>&#13;
            <a href="Fellowshipofth_foot-1.html#footnote_number_4">*</a>&#13;
         </sup>&#13;
         <a id="footnote_reference_4"/> was put together, with the assistance of material collected by Meriadoc. Though the dates given are often conjectural, especially&#13;
         for the Second Age, they deserve attention. It is probable that Meriadoc obtained assistance and information from Rivendell,&#13;
         which he visited more than once. There, though Elrond had departed, his sons long remained, &#13;
         <a id="page21"/>together with some of the High-elven folk. It is said that Celeborn went to dwell there after the departure of Galadriel;&#13;
         but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the Grey Havens, and with him went the last living memory of the&#13;
         Elder Days in Middle-earth.&#13;

            <em>Chapter</em> 1</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-1">A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be celebrating his eleventy-first birthday with a party&#13;
         of special magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance&#13;
         and unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was popularly&#13;
         believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure. And if that&#13;
         was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect&#13;
         on Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they began to call him <em>well-preserved</em>; but <em>unchanged</em> would have been nearer the mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much of a good thing; it&#13;
         seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It will have to be paid for,’ they said. ‘It isn’t natural, and trouble will come of it!’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. Baggins was generous with his money, most people were willing to forgive him his&#13;
         oddities and his good fortune. He remained on visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-Bagginses),&#13;
         and he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimportant families. But he had no close friends, until some&#13;
         of his younger cousins began to grow up.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page28"/>The eldest of these, and Bilbo’s favourite, was young Frodo Baggins. When Bilbo was ninety-nine he adopted Frodo as his heir,&#13;
         and brought him to live at Bag End; and the hopes of the Sackville-Bagginses were finally dashed. Bilbo and Frodo happened&#13;
         to have the same birthday, September 22nd. ‘You had better come and live here, Frodo my lad,’ said Bilbo one day; ‘and then&#13;
         we can celebrate our birthday-parties comfortably together.’ At that time Frodo was still in his <em>tweens</em>, as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty-three.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Twelve more years passed. Each year the Bagginses had given very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but now it was&#13;
         understood that something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be <em>eleventy-one</em>, 111, a rather curious number, and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only reached 130); and Frodo&#13;
         was going to be <em>thirty-three</em>, 33, an important number: the date of his ‘coming of age’.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Tongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and rumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire. The history and&#13;
         character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their&#13;
         reminiscences in welcome demand.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>No one had a more attentive audience than old Ham Gamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer. He held forth at <em>The Ivy Bush</em>, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years,&#13;
         and had helped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job&#13;
         was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo.&#13;
         They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. Bilbo, as I’ve always said,’ the Gaffer declared. With perfect truth: for Bilbo&#13;
         was very polite to him, calling him ‘Master Hamfast’, and &#13;
         <a id="page29"/>consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables – in the matter of ‘roots’, especially potatoes, the Gaffer was recognized&#13;
         as the leading authority by all in the neighbourhood (including himself ).&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But what about this Frodo that lives with him?’ asked Old Noakes of Bywater. ‘Baggins is his name, but he’s more than half&#13;
         a Brandybuck, they say. It beats me why any Baggins of Hobbiton should go looking for a wife away there in Buckland, where&#13;
         folks are so queer.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And no wonder they’re queer,’ put in Daddy Twofoot (the Gaffer’s next-door neighbour), ‘if they live on the wrong side of&#13;
         the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That’s a dark bad place, if half the tales be true.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You’re right, Dad!’ said the Gaffer. ‘Not that the Brandybucks of Buckland live <em>in</em> the Old Forest; but they’re a queer breed, seemingly. They fool about with boats on that big river – and that isn’t natural.&#13;
         Small wonder that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. Frodo is as nice a young hobbit as you could wish&#13;
         to meet. Very much like Mr. Bilbo, and in more than looks. After all his father was a Baggins. A decent respectable hobbit&#13;
         was Mr. Drogo Baggins; there was never much to tell of him, till he was drownded.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Drownded?’ said several voices. They had heard this and other darker rumours before, of course; but hobbits have a passion&#13;
         for family history, and they were ready to hear it again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, so they say,’ said the Gaffer. ‘You see: Mr. Drogo, he married poor Miss Primula Brandybuck. She was our Mr. Bilbo’s&#13;
         first cousin on the mother’s side (her mother being the youngest of the Old Took’s daughters); and Mr. Drogo was his second&#13;
         cousin. So Mr. Frodo is his first <em>and</em> second cousin, once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. Drogo was staying at Brandy Hall with&#13;
         his father-in-law, old Master Gorbadoc, as he often did after his marriage (him being partial to his vittles, and old Gorbadoc&#13;
         keeping a mighty generous table); and he went out &#13;
         <a id="page30"/><em>boating</em> on the Brandywine River; and he and his wife were drownded, and poor Mr. Frodo only a child and all.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I’ve heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,’ said Old Noakes; ‘and it was Drogo’s weight as sunk the&#13;
         boat.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And <em>I</em> heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,’ said Sandyman, the Hobbiton miller.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You shouldn’t listen to all you hear, Sandyman,’ said the Gaffer, who did not much like the miller. ‘There isn’t no call&#13;
         to go talking of pushing and pulling. Boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still without looking further for the&#13;
         cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded, as you might say, among those queer Bucklanders,&#13;
         being brought up anyhow in Brandy Hall. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master Gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple&#13;
         of hundred relations in the place. Mr. Bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought the lad back to live among decent&#13;
         folk.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But I reckon it was a nasty knock for those Sackville-Bagginses. They thought they were going to get Bag End, that time when&#13;
         he went off and was thought to be dead. And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and living, and&#13;
         never looking a day older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an heir, and has all the papers made out proper. The Sackville-Bagginses&#13;
         won’t never see the inside of Bag End now, or it is to be hoped not.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There’s a tidy bit of money tucked away up there, I hear tell,’ said a stranger, a visitor on business from Michel Delving&#13;
         in the Westfarthing. ‘All the top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver, <em>and</em> jools, by what I’ve heard.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then you’ve heard more than I can speak to,’ answered the Gaffer. ‘I know nothing about <em>jools</em>. Mr. Bilbo is free with his money, and there seems no lack of it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw Mr. Bilbo when he&#13;
         came back, a matter of sixty years ago, when I was a lad. I’d not long come prentice to old Holman (him being my dad’s cousin),&#13;
         but he &#13;
         <a id="page31"/>had me up at Bag End helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on. And&#13;
         in the middle of it all Mr. Bilbo comes up the Hill with a pony and some mighty big bags and a couple of chests. I don’t doubt&#13;
         they were mostly full of treasure he had picked up in foreign parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there&#13;
         wasn’t enough to fill tunnels. But my lad Sam will know more about that. He’s in and out of Bag End. Crazy about stories of&#13;
         the old days, he is, and he listens to all Mr. Bilbo’s tales. Mr. Bilbo has learned him his letters – meaning no harm, mark&#13;
         you, and I hope no harm will come of it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>Elves and Dragons!</em> I says to him. <em>Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and you. Don’t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or you’ll land&#13;
            in trouble too big for you</em>, I says to him. And I might say it to others,’ he added with a look at the stranger and the miller.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But the Gaffer did not convince his audience. The legend of Bilbo’s wealth was now too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger&#13;
         generation of hobbits.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at first,’ argued the miller, voicing common opinion. ‘He’s often&#13;
         away from home. And look at the outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at night, and that old wandering conjuror,&#13;
         Gandalf, and all. You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End’s a queer place, and its folk are queerer.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And you can say what <em>you</em> like, about what you know no more of than you do of boating, Mr. Sandyman,’ retorted the Gaffer, disliking the miller even&#13;
         more than usual. ‘If that’s being queer, then we could do with a bit more queerness in these parts. There’s some not far away&#13;
         that wouldn’t offer a pint of beer to a friend, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag&#13;
         End. Our Sam says that <em>everyone’s</em> going to be invited to the party, and there’s going to be presents, mark you, presents for all – this very month as is.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      &#13;
<p class="spb">&#13;
         <a id="page32"/>That very month was September, and as fine as you could ask. A day or two later a rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable&#13;
         Sam) was spread about that there were going to be fireworks – fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the Shire&#13;
         for nigh on a century, not indeed since the Old Took died.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Days passed and The Day drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking packages rolled into Hobbiton one evening&#13;
         and toiled up the Hill to Bag End. The startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it. It was driven by outlandish&#13;
         folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained at Bag End. At the end of the&#13;
         second week in September a cart came in through Bywater from the direction of Brandywine Bridge in broad daylight. An old&#13;
         man was driving it all alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white&#13;
         beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond the brim of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart all through Hobbiton&#13;
         and right up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly guessed. At Bilbo’s front door the old man began to unload:&#13;
         there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red G <img alt="art" src="images/Art_P032a.jpg"/> and the elf-rune, <img alt="art" src="images/Art_P032b.jpg"/> .&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>That was Gandalf ’s mark, of course, and the old man was Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due mainly to his&#13;
         skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real business was far more difficult and dangerous, but the Shire-folk knew nothing&#13;
         about it. To them he was just one of the ‘attractions’ at the Party. Hence the excitement of the hobbit-children. ‘G for Grand!’&#13;
         they shouted, and the old man smiled. They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped&#13;
         long; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays – they now belonged to&#13;
         a legendary past.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves, had finished unloading, Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but &#13;
         <a id="page33"/>not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘You will get plenty when the time comes.’ Then he disappeared inside with Bilbo, and the door&#13;
         was shut. The young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made off, feeling that the day of the party would&#13;
         never come.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Inside Bag End, Bilbo and Gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden. The late&#13;
         afternoon was bright and peaceful. The flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and sunflowers, and nasturtians trailing&#13;
         all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘How bright your garden looks!’ said Gandalf.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Bilbo. ‘I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old Shire; but I think I need a holiday.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You mean to go on with your plan then?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven’t changed it.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your plan – your whole plan, mind – and I hope it will turn out for the&#13;
         best, for you, and for all of us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on Thursday, and have my little joke.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who will laugh, I wonder?’ said Gandalf, shaking his head.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We shall see,’ said Bilbo.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The next day more carts rolled up the Hill, and still more carts. There might have been some grumbling about ‘dealing locally’,&#13;
         but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained&#13;
         in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. People became enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the days on&#13;
         the calendar; and they watched eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Before long the invitations began pouring out, and the &#13;
         <a id="page34"/>Hobbiton post-office was blocked, and the Bywater post-office was snowed under, and voluntary assistant postmen were called&#13;
         for. There was a constant stream of them going up the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on <em>Thank you, I shall certainly come</em>.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>A notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: <small>NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS</small>. Even those who had, or pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed inside. Bilbo was busy: writing invitations,&#13;
         ticking off answers, packing up presents, and making some private preparations of his own. From the time of Gandalf ’s arrival&#13;
         he remained hidden from view.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>One morning the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of Bilbo’s front door, covered with ropes and poles for tents&#13;
         and pavilions. A special entrance was cut into the bank leading to the road, and wide steps and a large white gate were built&#13;
         there. The three hobbit-families of Bagshot Row, adjoining the field, were intensely interested and generally envied. Old&#13;
         Gaffer Gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The tents began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big that the tree that grew in the field was right inside&#13;
         it, and stood proudly near one end, at the head of the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its branches. More promising&#13;
         still (to the hobbits’ mind): an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field. A draught of cooks,&#13;
         from every inn and eating-house for miles around, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered&#13;
         at Bag End. Excitement rose to its height.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday the eve of the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday, September the&#13;
         22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun began.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Bilbo Baggins called it a <em>party</em>, but it was really a variety of entertainments rolled into one. Practically everybody living near was invited. A very few&#13;
         were overlooked by accident, &#13;
         <a id="page35"/>but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter. Many people from other parts of the Shire were also asked; and there&#13;
         were even a few from outside the borders. Bilbo met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person. He gave away&#13;
         presents to all and sundry – the latter were those who went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate. Hobbits&#13;
         give presents to other people on their own birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not so lavishly as on this occasion;&#13;
         but it was not a bad system. Actually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year was somebody’s birthday, so that every&#13;
         hobbit in those parts had a fair chance of at least one present at least once a week. But they never got tired of them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost forgot&#13;
         about eating. There were toys the like of which they had never seen before, all beautiful and some obviously magical. Many&#13;
         of them had indeed been ordered a year before, and had come all the way from the Mountain and from Dale, and were of real&#13;
         dwarf-make.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, there were songs, dances, music, games, and, of course,&#13;
         food and drink. There were three official meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But lunch and tea were marked chiefly&#13;
         by the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together. At other times there were merely lots&#13;
         of people eating and drinking – continuously from elevenses until six-thirty, when the fireworks started.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The fireworks were by Gandalf: they were not only brought by him, but designed and made by him; and the special effects, set&#13;
         pieces, and flights of rockets were let off by him. But there was also a generous distribution of squibs, crackers, backarappers,&#13;
         sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and thunder-claps. They were all superb. The art of Gandalf&#13;
         improved with age.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices. There were green trees with trunks of dark&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page36"/>smoke: their leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down&#13;
         upon the astonished hobbits, disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned faces. There were fountains&#13;
         of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned into eagles,&#13;
         or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying swans; there was a red thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest&#13;
         of silver spears that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down again into the Water&#13;
         with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes. And there was also one last surprise, in honour of Bilbo, and it startled the hobbits&#13;
         exceedingly, as Gandalf intended. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a mountain seen in the&#13;
         distance, and began to glow at the summit. It spouted green and scarlet flames. Out flew a red-golden dragon – not life-size,&#13;
         but terribly life-like: fire came from his jaws, his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he whizzed three times over the&#13;
         heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a&#13;
         somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is the signal for supper!’ said Bilbo. The pain and alarm vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their&#13;
         feet. There was a splendid supper for everyone; for everyone, that is, except those invited to the special family dinner-party.&#13;
         This was held in the great pavilion with the tree. The invitations were limited to twelve dozen (a number also called by the&#13;
         hobbits one Gross, though the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected from all the&#13;
         families to which Bilbo and Frodo were related, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends (such as Gandalf ). Many&#13;
         young hobbits were included, and present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children in the matter&#13;
         of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal. Bringing up young hobbits took a lot of&#13;
         provender.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page37"/>There were many Bagginses and Boffins, and also many Tooks and Brandybucks; there were various Grubbs (relations of Bilbo&#13;
         Baggins’ grandmother), and various Chubbs (connexions of his Took grandfather); and a selection of Burrowses, Bolgers, Bracegirdles,&#13;
         Brockhouses, Goodbodies, Hornblowers and Proudfoots. Some of these were only very distantly connected with Bilbo, and some&#13;
         had hardly ever been in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of the Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten.&#13;
         Otho and his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and detested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card,&#13;
         written in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides, their cousin, Bilbo, had been specializing&#13;
         in food for many years and his table had a high reputation.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>All the one hundred and forty-four guests expected a pleasant feast; though they rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of&#13;
         their host (an inevitable item). He was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or two,&#13;
         would allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey. The guests were not disappointed: they had a <em>very</em> pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing entertainment: rich, abundant, varied, and prolonged. The purchase of provisions fell&#13;
         almost to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks; but as Bilbo’s catering had depleted the stocks of most of&#13;
         the stores, cellars and warehouses for miles around, that did not matter much.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After the feast (more or less) came the Speech. Most of the company were, however, now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful&#13;
         stage which they called ‘filling up the corners’. They were sipping their favourite drinks, and nibbling at their favourite&#13;
         dainties, and their fears were forgotten. They were prepared to listen to anything, and to cheer at every full stop.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>My dear People</em>, began Bilbo, rising in his place. ‘Hear! Hear! Hear!’ they shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant&#13;
         to follow their own advice. Bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chair under the illuminated tree. The light of the&#13;
         lanterns fell on his beaming face; the &#13;
         <a id="page38"/>golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving one hand in the air, the other&#13;
         was in his trouser-pocket.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>My dear Bagginses and Boffins</em>, he began again; <em>and my dear Tooks and Brandybucks, and Grubbs, and Chubbs, and Burrowses, and Hornblowers, and Bolgers, Bracegirdles, Goodbodies,&#13;
            Brockhouses and Proudfoots.</em> ‘Proud<small>FEET</small>!’ shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of course, was Proudfoot, and well merited; his feet&#13;
         were large, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>Proudfoots</em>, repeated Bilbo. <em>Also my good Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome back at last to Bag End. Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday: I&#13;
            am eleventy-one today!</em> ‘Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!’ they shouted, and they hammered joyously on the tables. Bilbo was doing splendidly.&#13;
         This was the sort of stuff they liked: short and obvious.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am.</em> Deafening cheers. Cries of <em>Yes</em> (and <em>No</em>). Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and flutes, and other musical instruments. There were, as has been said, many young&#13;
         hobbits present. Hundreds of musical crackers had been pulled. Most of them bore the mark dale on them; which did not convey&#13;
         much to most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of&#13;
         perfect make and enchanting tones. Indeed, in one corner some of the young Tooks and Brandybucks, supposing Uncle Bilbo to&#13;
         have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now got up an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune.&#13;
         Master Everard Took and Miss Melilot Brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the Springle-ring:&#13;
         a pretty dance, but rather vigorous.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But Bilbo had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster nearby, he blew three loud hoots. The noise subsided. <em>I shall not keep you long</em>, he cried. Cheers from all the assembly. <em>I have called you all together for a Purpose.</em> Something in the way that he said this made an impression. There was almost &#13;
         <a id="page39"/>silence, and one or two of the Tooks pricked up their ears.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>Indeed, for Three Purposes! First of all, to tell you that I am immensely fond of you all, and that eleventy-one years is&#13;
            too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits.</em> Tremendous outburst of approval.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.</em> This was unexpected and rather difficult. There was some scattered clapping, but most of them were trying to work it out&#13;
         and see if it came to a compliment.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>Secondly, to celebrate my birthday.</em> Cheers again. <em>I should say: OUR birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my heir and nephew, Frodo. He comes of age and into&#13;
            his inheritance today.</em> Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some loud shouts of ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,’ from the juniors. The Sackville-Bagginses&#13;
         scowled, and wondered what was meant by ‘coming into his inheritance’.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>Together we score one hundred and forty-four. Your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total: One Gross, if I may use&#13;
            the expression.</em> No cheers. This was ridiculous. Many of the guests, and especially the Sackville-Bagginses, were insulted, feeling sure they&#13;
         had only been asked to fill up the required number, like goods in a package. ‘One Gross, indeed! Vulgar expression.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary of my arrival by barrel at Esgaroth on the Long&#13;
            Lake; though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only fifty-one then, and birthdays&#13;
            did not seem so important. The banquet was very splendid, however, though I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and could&#13;
            only say ‘thag you very buch’. I now repeat it more correctly: Thank you very much for coming to my little party.</em> Obstinate silence. They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and they were getting bored. Why couldn’t&#13;
         he stop talking and let them drink his health? But Bilbo did not sing or recite. He paused for a moment.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>Thirdly and finally</em>, he said, <em>I wish to make an</em> <a id="page40"/><em>ANNOUNCEMENT.</em> He spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that everyone sat up who still could. <em>I regret to announce that – though, as I said, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to spend among you – this is the&#13;
            END. I am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and the guests all blinked. When they opened their eyes&#13;
         Bilbo was nowhere to be seen. One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old Odo Proudfoot removed&#13;
         his feet from the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly, after several deep breaths, every Baggins,&#13;
         Boffin, Took, Brandybuck, Grubb, Chubb, Burrows, Bolger, Bracegirdle, Brockhouse, Goodbody, Hornblower, and Proudfoot began&#13;
         to talk at once.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock&#13;
         and annoyance. ‘He’s mad. I always said so,’ was probably the most popular comment. Even the Tooks (with a few exceptions)&#13;
         thought Bilbo’s behaviour was absurd. For the moment most of them took it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more&#13;
         than a ridiculous prank.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But old Rory Brandybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law,&#13;
         Esmeralda: ‘There’s something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad Baggins is off again. Silly old fool. But why worry?&#13;
         He hasn’t taken the vittles with him.’ He called loudly to Frodo to send the wine round again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo was the only one present who had said nothing. For some time he had sat silent beside Bilbo’s empty chair, and ignored&#13;
         all remarks and questions. He had enjoyed the joke, of course, even though he had been in the know. He had difficulty in keeping&#13;
         from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests. But at the same time he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly&#13;
         that he loved the old hobbit dearly. Most of the guests went on eating and drinking and discussing Bilbo Baggins’ oddities,&#13;
         past and present; but the Sackville-Bagginses &#13;
         <a id="page41"/>had already departed in wrath. Frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for more wine to be&#13;
         served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of Bilbo, and slipped out of the pavilion.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">As for Bilbo Baggins, even while he was making his speech, he had been fingering the golden ring in his pocket: his magic&#13;
         ring that he had kept secret for so many years. As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger, and he was never seen by any&#13;
         hobbit in Hobbiton again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He walked briskly back to his hole, and stood for a moment listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion, and to the sounds&#13;
         of merrymaking in other parts of the field. Then he went in. He took off his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in tissue-paper&#13;
         his embroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away. Then he put on quickly some old untidy garments, and fastened round his waist&#13;
         a worn leather belt. On it he hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer, smelling of moth-balls,&#13;
         he took out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up as if they were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained&#13;
         that their original colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark green. They were rather too large for him. He&#13;
         then went into his study, and from a large strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a leather-bound manuscript;&#13;
         and also a large bulky envelope. The book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing there, already&#13;
         nearly full. Into the envelope he slipped his golden ring, and its fine chain, and then sealed it, and addressed it to Frodo.&#13;
         At first he put it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket. At that moment the door opened&#13;
         and Gandalf came quickly in.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hullo!’ said Bilbo. ‘I wondered if you would turn up.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am glad to find you visible,’ replied the wizard, sitting down in a chair, ‘I wanted to catch you and have a few &#13;
         <a id="page42"/>final words. I suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to plan?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, I do,’ said Bilbo. ‘Though that flash was surprising: it quite startled me, let alone the others. A little addition&#13;
         of your own, I suppose?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was. You have wisely kept that ring secret all these years, and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests something&#13;
         else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And would spoil my joke. You are an interfering old busybody,’ laughed Bilbo, ‘but I expect you know best, as usual.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do – when I know anything. But I don’t feel too sure about this whole affair. It has now come to the final point. You have&#13;
         had your joke, and alarmed or offended most of your relations, and given the whole Shire something to talk about for nine&#13;
         days, or ninety-nine more likely. Are you going any further?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, I am. I feel I need a holiday, a very long holiday, as I have told you before. Probably a permanent holiday: I don’t&#13;
         expect I shall return. In fact, I don’t mean to, and I have made all arrangements.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am old, Gandalf. I don’t look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts. <em>Well-preserved</em> indeed!’ he snorted. ‘Why, I feel all thin, sort of <em>stretched</em>, if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over too much bread. That can’t be right. I need a change, or&#13;
         something.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf looked curiously and closely at him. ‘No, it does not seem right,’ he said thoughtfully. ‘No, after all I believe&#13;
         your plan is probably the best.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, I’ve made up my mind, anyway. I want to see mountains again, Gandalf – <em>mountains</em>; and then find somewhere where I can <em>rest</em>. In peace and quiet, without a lot of relatives prying around, and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell. I&#13;
         might find somewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought of a nice ending for it: <em>and he lived happily ever after to the end of his days.</em>’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf laughed. ‘I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however it ends.’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page43"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh, they may, in years to come. Frodo has read some already, as far as it has gone. You’ll keep an eye on Frodo, won’t you?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, I will – two eyes, as often as I can spare them.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he offered to once, just before the party. But he does not really&#13;
         want to, yet. I want to see the wild country again before I die, and the Mountains; but he is still in love with the Shire,&#13;
         with woods and fields and little rivers. He ought to be comfortable here. I am leaving everything to him, of course, except&#13;
         a few oddments. I hope he will be happy, when he gets used to being on his own. It’s time he was his own master now.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Everything?’ said Gandalf. ‘The ring as well? You agreed to that, you remember.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, er, yes, I suppose so,’ stammered Bilbo. ‘Where is it?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘In an envelope, if you must know,’ said Bilbo impatiently. ‘There on the mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!’&#13;
         He hesitated. ‘Isn’t that odd now?’ he said softly to himself. ‘Yet after all, why not? Why shouldn’t it stay there?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf looked again very hard at Bilbo, and there was a gleam in his eyes. ‘I think, Bilbo,’ he said quietly, ‘I should leave&#13;
         it behind. Don’t you want to?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well yes – and no. Now it comes to it, I don’t like parting with it at all, I may say. And I don’t really see why I should.&#13;
         Why do you want me to?’ he asked, and a curious change came over his voice. It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance. ‘You&#13;
         are always badgering me about my ring; but you have never bothered me about the other things that I got on my journey.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, but I had to badger you,’ said Gandalf. ‘I wanted the truth. It was important. Magic rings are – well, magical; and they&#13;
         are rare and curious. I was professionally interested in your ring, you may say; and I still am. I should like to know where&#13;
         it is, if you go wandering again. Also I think <em>you</em> have &#13;
         <a id="page44"/>had it quite long enough. You won’t need it any more, Bilbo, unless I am quite mistaken.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Bilbo flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly face grew hard. ‘Why not?’ he cried. ‘And what business&#13;
         is it of yours, anyway, to know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found it. It came to me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is no need to get angry.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘If I am it is your fault,’ said Bilbo. ‘It is mine, I tell you. My own. My Precious. Yes, my Precious.’</p>&#13;
      <p>The wizard’s face remained grave and attentive, and only a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed&#13;
         alarmed. ‘It has been called that before,’ he said, ‘but not by you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But I say it now. And why not? Even if Gollum said the same once. It’s not his now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf stood up. He spoke sternly. ‘You will be a fool if you do, Bilbo,’ he said. ‘You make that clearer with every word&#13;
         you say. It has got far too much hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be free.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I’ll do as I choose and go as I please,’ said Bilbo obstinately.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now, now, my dear hobbit!’ said Gandalf. ‘All your long life we have been friends, and you owe me something. Come! Do as&#13;
         you promised: give it up!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo. ‘But you won’t get it. I won’t give my Precious away, I tell you.’&#13;
         His hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf ’s eyes flashed. ‘It will be my turn to get angry soon,’ he said. ‘If you say that again, I shall. Then you will see&#13;
         Gandalf the Grey uncloaked.’ He took a step towards the hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall and menacing; his shadow filled&#13;
         the little room.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Bilbo backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clutching at his pocket. They stood for a while facing one another,&#13;
         and the air of the room tingled. Gandalf ’s eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, and he began to tremble.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page45"/>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know what has come over you, Gandalf,’ he said. ‘You have never been like this before. What is it all about? It is&#13;
         mine isn’t it? I found it, and Gollum would have killed me, if I hadn’t kept it. I’m not a thief, whatever he said.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have never called you one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I am not one either. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I&#13;
         wish you would trust me, as you used.’ He turned away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man,&#13;
         bent and troubled.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes. ‘I am sorry,’ he said. ‘But I felt so queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not&#13;
         to be bothered with it any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking&#13;
         at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and disappear, don’t you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out&#13;
         to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn’t rest without it in my pocket. I don’t know why. And I don’t seem&#13;
         able to make up my mind.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then trust mine,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is quite made up. Go away and leave it behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to Frodo,&#13;
         and I will look after him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided. Presently he sighed. ‘All right,’ he said with an effort. ‘I will.’ Then he&#13;
         shrugged his shoulders, and smiled rather ruefully. ‘After all that’s what this party business was all about, really: to give&#13;
         away lots of birthday-presents, and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn’t made it any easier&#13;
         in the end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. It would quite spoil the joke.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,’ said Gandalf.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very well,’ said Bilbo, ‘it goes to Frodo with all the rest.’ He drew a deep breath. ‘And now I really must be starting,&#13;
         or somebody else will catch me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn’t bear to do it all over again.’ He picked up his bag and&#13;
         moved to the door.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You have still got the ring in your pocket,’ said the wizard.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page46"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, so I have!’ cried Bilbo. ‘And my will and all the other documents too. You had better take it and deliver it for me.&#13;
         That will be safest.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, don’t give the ring to me,’ said Gandalf. ‘Put it on the mantelpiece. It will be safe enough there, till Frodo comes.&#13;
         I shall wait for him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Bilbo took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the clock, his hand jerked back, and the packet fell on&#13;
         the floor. Before he could pick it up, the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place. A spasm of anger passed swiftly&#13;
         over the hobbit’s face again. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, that’s that,’ he said. ‘Now I’m off!’</p>&#13;
      <p>They went out into the hall. Bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand; then he whistled. Three dwarves came out of different&#13;
         rooms where they had been busy.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Is everything ready?’ asked Bilbo. ‘Everything packed and labelled?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Everything,’ they answered.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, let’s start then!’ He stepped out of the front-door.</p>&#13;
      <p>It was a fine night, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked up, sniffing the air. ‘What fun! What fun to be off&#13;
         again, off on the Road with dwarves! This is what I have really been longing for, for years! Good-bye!’ he said, looking at&#13;
         his old home and bowing to the door. ‘Good-bye, Gandalf!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good-bye, for the present, Bilbo. Take care of yourself! You are old enough, and perhaps wise enough.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Take care! I don’t care. Don’t you worry about me! I am as happy now as I have ever been, and that is saying a great deal.&#13;
         But the time has come. I am being swept off my feet at last,’ he added, and then in a low voice, as if to himself, he sang&#13;
         softly in the dark:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>The Road goes ever on and on</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Down from the door where it began.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Now far ahead the Road has gone,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>And I must follow, if I can,</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page47"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Pursuing it with eager feet,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Until it joins some larger way</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Where many paths and errands meet.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>And whither then? I cannot say.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="p1">He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he turned away from the lights and voices in the field and tents,&#13;
         and followed by his three companions went round into his garden, and trotted down the long sloping path. He jumped over a&#13;
         low place in the hedge at the bottom, and took to the meadows, passing into the night like a rustle of wind in the grass.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness. ‘Good-bye, my dear Bilbo – until our next meeting!’ he said&#13;
         softly and went back indoors.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Frodo came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep in thought. ‘Has he gone?’ he asked.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ answered Gandalf, ‘he has gone at last.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wish – I mean, I hoped until this evening that it was only a joke,’ said Frodo. ‘But I knew in my heart that he really&#13;
         meant to go. He always used to joke about serious things. I wish I had come back sooner, just to see him off.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,’ said Gandalf. ‘Don’t be too troubled. He’ll be all right –&#13;
         now. He left a packet for you. There it is!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but did not open it.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You’ll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,’ said the wizard. ‘You are the master of Bag End now.&#13;
         And also, I fancy, you’ll find a golden ring.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The ring!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still, it may be useful.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It may, and it may not,’ said Gandalf. ‘I should not make use of it, if I were you. But keep it secret, and keep it safe!&#13;
         Now I am going to bed.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      &#13;
<p class="spb">&#13;
         <a id="page48"/>As master of Bag End Frodo felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to the guests. Rumours of strange events had by now spread&#13;
         all over the field, but Frodo would only say <em>no doubt everything will be cleared up in the morning</em>. About midnight carriages came for the important folk. One by one they rolled away, filled with full but very unsatisfied&#13;
         hobbits. Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in wheelbarrows those that had inadvertently remained behind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. Morning went on. People came and began (by orders) to clear&#13;
         away the pavilions and the tables and the chairs, and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and&#13;
         the flowering shrubs in boxes, and the crumbs and cracker-paper, the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs, and the&#13;
         uneaten food (a very small item). Then a number of other people came (without orders): Bagginses, and Boffins, and Bolgers,&#13;
         and Tooks, and other guests that lived or were staying near. By mid-day, when even the best-fed were out and about again,&#13;
         there was a large crowd at Bag End, uninvited but not unexpected.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and worried. He welcomed all the callers, but he had not&#13;
         much more to say than before. His reply to all inquiries was simply this: ‘Mr. Bilbo Baggins has gone away; as far as I know,&#13;
         for good.’ Some of the visitors he invited to come inside, as Bilbo had left ‘messages’ for them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and small articles of furniture. On every item&#13;
         there was a label tied. There were several labels of this sort:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>For ADELARD TOOK, for his VERY OWN, from Bilbo</em>;on an umbrella. Adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>For DORA BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love from Bilbo</em>; on a large waste-paper basket. Dora was Drogo’s sister and the eldest surviving female relative of Bilbo and Frodo; she&#13;
         was ninety-nine, and had written reams of good advice for more than half a century.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page49"/><em>For MILO BURROWS, hoping it will be useful, from B.B.</em>; on a gold pen and ink-bottle. Milo never answered letters.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>For ANGELICA’S use, from Uncle Bilbo</em>; on a round convex mirror. She was a young Baggins, and too obviously considered her face shapely.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>For the collection of HUGO BRACEGIRDLE, from a contributor</em>; on an (empty) book-case. Hugo was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual at returning them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>For LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT</em>; on a case of silver spoons. Bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons, while he was away on his former&#13;
         journey. Lobelia knew that quite well. When she arrived later in the day, she took the point at once, but she also took the&#13;
         spoons.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. Bilbo’s residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the&#13;
         course of his long life. It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the custom of giving so many birthday-presents&#13;
         was largely responsible. Not, of course, that the birthday-presents were always <em>new</em>; there were one or two old <em>mathoms</em> of forgotten uses that had circulated all around the district; but Bilbo had usually given new presents, and kept those that&#13;
         he received. The old hole was now being cleared a little.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Every one of the various parting gifts had labels, written out personally by Bilbo, and several had some point, or some joke.&#13;
         But, of course, most of the things were given where they would be wanted and welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially those&#13;
         of Bagshot Row, did very well. Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle&#13;
         of ointment for creaking joints. Old Rory Brandybuck, in return for much hospitality, got a dozen bottles of Old Winyards:&#13;
         a strong red wine from the Southfarthing, and now quite mature, as it had been laid down by Bilbo’s father. Rory quite forgave&#13;
         Bilbo, and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page50"/>There was plenty of everything left for Frodo. And, of course, all the chief treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and&#13;
         more than enough furniture, were left in his possession. There was, however, no sign nor mention of money or jewellery: not&#13;
         a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Frodo had a very trying time that afternoon. A false rumour that the whole household was being distributed free spread like&#13;
         wildfire; and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there, but could not be kept out. Labels got&#13;
         torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall; and others tried to make&#13;
         off with minor items not addressed to them, or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched. The road to the gate was blocked&#13;
         with barrows and handcarts.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-Bagginses arrived. Frodo had retired for a while and left his friend Merry Brandybuck&#13;
         to keep an eye on things. When Otho loudly demanded to see Frodo, Merry bowed politely.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He is indisposed,’ he said. ‘He is resting.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hiding, you mean,’ said Lobelia. ‘Anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him. Just go and tell him so!’</p>&#13;
      <p>Merry left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover their parting gift of spoons. It did not improve their&#13;
         tempers. Eventually they were shown into the study. Frodo was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him. He&#13;
         looked indisposed – to see Sackville-Bagginses at any rate; and he stood up, fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he&#13;
         spoke quite politely.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Sackville-Bagginses were rather offensive. They began by offering him bad bargain-prices (as between friends) for various&#13;
         valuable and unlabelled things. When Frodo replied that only the things specially directed by Bilbo were being given away,&#13;
         they said the whole affair was very fishy.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Only one thing is clear to me,’ said Otho, ‘and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing&#13;
         the will.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page51"/>Otho would have been Bilbo’s heir, but for the adoption of Frodo. He read the will carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately,&#13;
         very clear and correct (according to the legal customs of hobbits, which demand among other things seven signatures of witnesses&#13;
         in red ink).&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Foiled again!’ he said to his wife. ‘And after waiting <em>sixty</em> years. Spoons? Fiddlesticks!’ He snapped his fingers under Frodo’s nose and stumped off. But Lobelia was not so easily got&#13;
         rid of. A little later Frodo came out of the study to see how things were going on, and found her still about the place, investigating&#13;
         nooks and corners, and tapping the floors. He escorted her firmly off the premises, after he had relieved her of several small&#13;
         (but rather valuable) articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she was in the throes of&#13;
         thinking out a really crushing parting remark; but all she found to say, turning round on the step, was:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You’ll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn’t you go too? You don’t belong here; you’re no Baggins – you – you’re a&#13;
         Brandybuck!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Did you hear that, Merry? That was an insult, if you like,’ said Frodo as he shut the door on her.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was a compliment,’ said Merry Brandybuck, ‘and so, of course, not true.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Then they went round the hole, and evicted three young hobbits (two Boffins and a Bolger) who were knocking holes in the walls&#13;
         of one of the cellars. Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho Proudfoot (old Odo Proudfoot’s grandson), who had begun an&#13;
         excavation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. The legend of Bilbo’s gold excited both curiosity and&#13;
         hope; for legendary gold (mysteriously obtained, if not positively ill-gotten), is, as everyone knows, anyone’s for the finding&#13;
         – unless the search is interrupted.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When he had overcome Sancho and pushed him out, Frodo collapsed on a chair in the hall. ‘It’s time to close the shop, Merry,’&#13;
         he said. ‘Lock the door, and don’t open it to &#13;
         <a id="page52"/>anyone today, not even if they bring a battering ram.’ Then he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. ‘Lobelia again most likely,’ he thought. ‘She must&#13;
         have thought of something really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder, but he took no notice. Suddenly the wizard’s head appeared at&#13;
         the window.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If you don’t let me in, Frodo, I shall blow your door right down your hole and out through the hill,’ he said.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘My dear Gandalf! Half a minute!’ cried Frodo, running out of the room to the door. ‘Come in! Come in! I thought it was Lobelia.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, driving a pony-trap towards Bywater with a face that would have curdled&#13;
         new milk.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘She had already nearly curdled me. Honestly, I nearly tried on Bilbo’s ring. I longed to disappear.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Don’t do that!’ said Gandalf, sitting down. ‘Do be careful of that ring, Frodo! In fact, it is partly about that that I have&#13;
         come to say a last word.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, what about it?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you know already?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Only what Bilbo told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and how he used it: on his journey, I mean.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Which story, I wonder,’ said Gandalf.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,’ said Frodo. ‘He told me the true story soon after I came to live here.&#13;
         He said you had pestered him till he told you, so I had better know too. “No secrets between us, Frodo,” he said; “but they&#13;
         are not to go any further. It’s mine anyway.” ’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That’s interesting,’ said Gandalf. ‘Well, what did you think of it all?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘If you mean, inventing all that about a “present”, well, I thought the true story much more likely, and I couldn’t see &#13;
         <a id="page53"/>the point of altering it at all. It was very unlike Bilbo to do so, anyway; and I thought it rather odd.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures – if they use them. Let it be a warning to you to&#13;
         be very careful with it. It may have other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t understand,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Neither do I,’ answered the wizard. ‘I have merely begun to wonder about the ring, especially since last night. No need to&#13;
         worry. But if you take my advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all. At least I beg you not to use it in any way that&#13;
         will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say again: keep it safe, and keep it secret!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You are very mysterious! What are you afraid of?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you something when I come back. I am going off at once: so&#13;
         this is good-bye for the present.’ He got up.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘At once!’ cried Frodo. ‘Why, I thought you were staying on for at least a week. I was looking forward to your help.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I did mean to – but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a good while; but I’ll come and see you again, as soon&#13;
         as I can. Expect me when you see me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan’t often be visiting the Shire openly again. I find that&#13;
         I have become rather unpopular. They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace. Some people are actually accusing me&#13;
         of spiriting Bilbo away, or worse. If you want to know, there is supposed to be a plot between you and me to get hold of his&#13;
         wealth.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Some people!’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘You mean Otho and Lobelia. How abominable! I would give them Bag End and everything else,&#13;
         if I could get Bilbo back and go off tramping in the country with him. I love the Shire. But I begin to wish, somehow, that&#13;
         I had gone too. I wonder if I shall ever see him again.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So do I,’ said Gandalf. ‘And I wonder many other things. Good-bye now! Take care of yourself! Look out for me, especially&#13;
         at unlikely times! Good-bye!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page54"/>Frodo saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked off at a surprising pace; but Frodo thought the old&#13;
         wizard looked unusually bent, almost as if he was carrying a great weight. The evening was closing in, and his cloaked figure&#13;
         quickly vanished into the twilight. Frodo did not see him again for a long time.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

            <em>Chapter</em> 2</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-2">THE SHADOW OF THE PAST</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. The second disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in&#13;
         Hobbiton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story&#13;
         for young hobbits; and eventually Mad Baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels&#13;
         and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgotten.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at&#13;
         last gone quite mad, and had run off into the Blue. There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic,&#13;
         but hardly an untimely, end. The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he’ll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense,’ they said.&#13;
         And to all appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the growth of hobbit-sense was not very&#13;
         noticeable. Indeed, he at once began to carry on Bilbo’s reputation for oddity. He refused to go into mourning; and the next&#13;
         year he gave a party in honour of Bilbo’s hundred-and-twelfth birthday, which he called a Hundred-weight Feast. But that was&#13;
         short of the mark, for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and rained drink, as&#13;
         hobbits say.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving Bilbo’s Birthday Party year after year until they&#13;
         got used to it. He said that he did not think Bilbo was &#13;
         <a id="page56"/>dead. When they asked: ‘Where is he then?’ he shrugged his shoulders.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends, especially among the younger hobbits (mostly descendants&#13;
         of the Old Took) who had as children been fond of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End. Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger&#13;
         were two of these; but his closest friends were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name&#13;
         was Meriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by&#13;
         himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the&#13;
         starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected that he visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good ‘preservation’: outwardly he retained the appearance&#13;
         of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. ‘Some folk have all the luck,’ they said; but it was not until Frodo&#13;
         approached the usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master and <em>the</em> Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant. For some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the future. But&#13;
         half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing. He found himself wondering at times,&#13;
         especially in the autumn, about the wild lands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams.&#13;
         He began to say to himself: ‘Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day.’ To which the other half of his mind always replied:&#13;
         ‘Not yet.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he&#13;
         felt was somehow significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo&#13;
         began to feel restless, and the old paths seemed too &#13;
         <a id="page57"/>well-trodden. He looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces&#13;
         beyond its borders. He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and Merry and his other friends watched&#13;
         him anxiously. Often he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent&#13;
         any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen&#13;
         passing westward through the woods in the evening, passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were&#13;
         no longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road in unusual numbers. The ancient East–West&#13;
         Road ran through the Shire to its end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the&#13;
         Blue Mountains. They were the hobbits’ chief source of news from distant parts – if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said&#13;
         little and hobbits asked no more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries, seeking refuge in the West. They&#13;
         were troubled, and some spoke in whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a shadow in the background of their memories; but it was&#13;
         ominous and disquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out by the White Council only to reappear&#13;
         in greater strength in the old strongholds of Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From there the power was&#13;
         spreading far and wide, and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains.&#13;
         Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures&#13;
         more terrible than all these, but they had no name.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page58"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits. But even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear&#13;
         queer tales; and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things. The conversation in <em>The Green Dragon</em> at Bywater, one evening in the spring of Frodo’s fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Shire rumours&#13;
         had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam Gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire, and opposite him was Ted Sandyman, the miller’s son; and there were various&#13;
         other rustic hobbits listening to their talk.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Queer things you do hear these days, to be sure,’ said Sam.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah,’ said Ted, ‘you do, if you listen. But I can hear fireside-tales and children’s stories at home, if I want to.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No doubt you can,’ retorted Sam, ‘and I daresay there’s more truth in some of them than you reckon. Who invented the stories&#13;
         anyway? Take dragons now.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No thank ’ee,’ said Ted, ‘I won’t. I heard tell of them when I was a youngster, but there’s no call to believe in them now.&#13;
         There’s only one Dragon in Bywater, and that’s Green,’ he said, getting a general laugh.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All right,’ said Sam, laughing with the rest. ‘But what about these Tree-men, these giants, as you might call them? They&#13;
         do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the North Moors not long back.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who’s <em>they</em>?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘My cousin Hal for one. He works for Mr. Boffin at Overhill and goes up to the Northfarthing for the hunting. He <em>saw</em> one.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Says he did, perhaps. Your Hal’s always saying he’s seen things; and maybe he sees things that ain’t there.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘But this one was as big as an elm tree, and walking – walking seven yards to a stride, if it was an inch.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then I bet it wasn’t an inch. What he saw <em>was</em> an elm tree, as like as not.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But this one was <em>walking</em>, I tell you; and there ain’t no elm tree on the North Moors.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page59"/>‘Then Hal can’t have seen one,’ said Ted. There was some laughing and clapping: the audience seemed to think that Ted had&#13;
         scored a point.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All the same,’ said Sam, ‘you can’t deny that others besides our Halfast have seen queer folk crossing the Shire – crossing&#13;
         it, mind you: there are more that are turned back at the borders. The Bounders have never been so busy before.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And I’ve heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say they are going to the harbours, out away beyond the White Towers.’&#13;
         Sam waved his arm vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the old towers beyond the western&#13;
         borders of the Shire. But it was an old tradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens, from which at times elven-ships&#13;
         set sail, never to return.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the Sea, they are going into the West and leaving us,’ said Sam, half chanting the&#13;
         words, shaking his head sadly and solemnly. But Ted laughed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, that isn’t anything new, if you believe the old tales. And I don’t see what it matters to me or you. Let them sail!&#13;
         But I warrant you haven’t seen them doing it; nor anyone else in the Shire.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, I don’t know,’ said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he had once seen an Elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more&#13;
         one day. Of all the legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and half-remembered stories about&#13;
         the Elves as the hobbits knew, had always moved him most deeply. ‘There are some, even in these parts, as know the Fair Folk&#13;
         and get news of them,’ he said. ‘There’s Mr. Baggins now, that I work for. He told me that they were sailing and he knows&#13;
         a bit about Elves. And old Mr. Bilbo knew more: many’s the talk I had with him when I was a little lad.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh, they’re both cracked,’ said Ted. ‘Leastways old Bilbo was cracked, and Frodo’s cracking. If that’s where you get your&#13;
         news from, you’ll never want for moonshine. Well, friends, I’m off home. Your good health!’ He drained his mug and went out&#13;
         noisily.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page60"/>Sam sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think about. For one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End&#13;
         garden, and he would have a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But Sam had more on his&#13;
         mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up and went out.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was early April and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain. The sun was down, and a cool pale evening was quietly fading&#13;
         into night. He walked home under the early stars through Hobbiton and up the Hill, whistling softly and thoughtfully.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">It was just at this time that Gandalf reappeared after his long absence. For three years after the Party he had been away.&#13;
         Then he paid Frodo a brief visit, and after taking a good look at him he went off again. During the next year or two he had&#13;
         turned up fairly often, coming unexpectedly after dusk, and going off without warning before sunrise. He would not discuss&#13;
         his own business and journeys, and seemed chiefly interested in small news about Frodo’s health and doings.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over nine years since Frodo had seen or heard of him, and he had begun to think&#13;
         that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits. But that evening, as Sam was walking home and&#13;
         twilight was fading, there came the once familiar tap on the study window.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight. They looked hard at one another.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘All well eh?’ said Gandalf. ‘You look the same as ever, Frodo!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘So do you,’ Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that Gandalf looked older and more careworn. He pressed him for news of&#13;
         himself and of the wide world, and soon they were deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the night.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Next morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with Frodo by the open window of the study. A bright fire &#13;
         <a id="page61"/>was on the hearth, but the sun was warm, and the wind was in the South. Everything looked fresh, and the new green of spring&#13;
         was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees’ fingers.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years before, when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a handkerchief. His&#13;
         hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer, and his face more lined with&#13;
         care and wisdom; but his eyes were as bright as ever, and he smoked and blew smoke-rings with the same vigour and delight.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He was smoking now in silence, for Frodo was sitting still, deep in thought. Even in the light of morning he felt the dark&#13;
         shadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought. At last he broke the silence.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring, Gandalf,’ he said. ‘And then you stopped, because you said&#13;
         that such matters were best left until daylight. Don’t you think you had better finish now? You say the ring is dangerous,&#13;
         far more dangerous than I guess. In what way?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘In many ways,’ answered the wizard. ‘It is far more powerful than I ever dared to think at first, so powerful that in the&#13;
         end it would utterly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you call them, and they were, of course, of various kinds:&#13;
         some more potent and some less. The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths&#13;
         they were but trifles – yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals. But the Great Rings, the Rings of Power, they were perilous.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘A mortal, Frodo, who keeps one of the Great Rings, does not die, but he does not grow or obtain more life, he merely continues,&#13;
         until at last every minute is a weariness. And if he often uses the Ring to make himself invisible, he <em>fades</em>: he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks in the twilight under the eye of the Dark Power that rules the Rings.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page62"/>Yes, sooner or later – later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength nor good purpose will last&#13;
         – sooner or later the Dark Power will devour him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘How terrifying!’ said Frodo. There was another long silence. The sound of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘How long have you known this?’ asked Frodo at length. ‘And how much did Bilbo know?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,’ said Gandalf. ‘He would certainly never have passed on to you anything that&#13;
         he thought would be a danger, even though I promised to look after you. He thought the ring was very beautiful, and very useful&#13;
         at need; and if anything was wrong or queer, it was himself. He said that it was “growing on his mind”, and he was always&#13;
         worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame. Though he had found out that the thing needed&#13;
         looking after; it did not seem always of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in an odd way, and might suddenly&#13;
         slip off a finger where it had been tight.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,’ said Frodo, ‘so I have always kept it on its chain.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very wise,’ said Gandalf. ‘But as for his long life, Bilbo never connected it with the ring at all. He took all the credit&#13;
         for that to himself, and he was very proud of it. Though he was getting restless and uneasy. <em>Thin and stretched</em> he said. A sign that the ring was getting control.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘How long have you known all this?’ asked Frodo again.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Known?’ said Gandalf. ‘I have known much that only the Wise know, Frodo. But if you mean “known about <em>this</em> ring”, well, I still do not <em>know</em>, one might say. There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘When did I first begin to guess?’ he mused, searching back in memory. ‘Let me see – it was in the year that the White Council&#13;
         drove the Dark Power from Mirkwood, just before the Battle of Five Armies, that Bilbo found his ring. A shadow &#13;
         <a id="page63"/>fell on my heart then, though I did not know yet what I feared. I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly&#13;
         it was – that at least was clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo’s strange story of how he had “won” it, and I could not&#13;
         believe it. When I at last got the truth out of him, I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring beyond&#13;
         doubt. Much like Gollum with his “birthday-present”. The lies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly the ring had an&#13;
         unwholesome power that set to work on its keeper at once. That was the first real warning I had that all was not well. I told&#13;
         Bilbo often that such rings were better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little else that I&#13;
         could do. I could not take it from him without doing greater harm; and I had no right to do so anyway. I could only watch&#13;
         and wait. I might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held me back.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who is he?’ asked Frodo. ‘I have never heard of him before.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Maybe not,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Hobbits are, or were, no concern of his. Yet he is great among the Wise. He is the chief of&#13;
         my order and the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling.&#13;
         The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, is his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their making;&#13;
         but when the Rings were debated in the Council, all that he would reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So&#13;
         my doubt slept – but uneasily. Still I watched and I waited.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And all seemed well with Bilbo. And the years passed. Yes, they passed, and they seemed not to touch him. He showed no signs&#13;
         of age. The shadow fell on me again. But I said to myself: “After all he comes of a long-lived family on his mother’s side.&#13;
         There is time yet. Wait!”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And I waited. Until that night when he left this house. He said and did things then that filled me with a fear that no words&#13;
         of Saruman could allay. I knew at last that something &#13;
         <a id="page64"/>dark and deadly was at work. And I have spent most of the years since then in finding out the truth of it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There wasn’t any permanent harm done, was there?’ asked Frodo anxiously. ‘He would get all right in time, wouldn’t he? Be&#13;
         able to rest in peace, I mean?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He felt better at once,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is only one Power in this world that knows all about the Rings and their&#13;
         effects; and as far as I know there is no Power in the world that knows all about hobbits. Among the Wise I am the only one&#13;
         that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch of knowledge, but full of surprises. Soft as butter they can be, and yet sometimes&#13;
         as tough as old tree-roots. I think it likely that some would resist the Rings far longer than most of the Wise would believe.&#13;
         I don’t think you need worry about Bilbo.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, so it might take a long while for the influence to wear off&#13;
         – before it was safe for him to see it again, for instance. Otherwise, he might live on for years, quite happily: just stop&#13;
         as he was when he parted with it. For he gave it up in the end of his own accord: an important point. No, I was not troubled&#13;
         about dear Bilbo any more, once he had let the thing go. It is for <em>you</em> that I feel responsible.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ever since Bilbo left I have been deeply concerned about you, and about all these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It&#13;
         would be a grievous blow to the world, if the Dark Power overcame the Shire; if all your kind, jolly, stupid Bolgers, Hornblowers,&#13;
         Boffins, Bracegirdles, and the rest, not to mention the ridiculous Bagginses, became enslaved.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo shuddered. ‘But why should we be?’ he asked. ‘And why should he want such slaves?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘To tell you the truth,’ replied Gandalf, ‘I believe that hitherto – <em>hitherto</em>, mark you – he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits. You should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He does&#13;
         not need you – he has many more useful servants – but he won’t forget you again. And hobbits as miserable slaves would please&#13;
         him far more than &#13;
         <a id="page65"/>hobbits happy and free. There is such a thing as malice and revenge.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Revenge?’ said Frodo. ‘Revenge for what? I still don’t understand what all this has to do with Bilbo and myself, and our&#13;
         ring.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It has everything to do with it,’ said Gandalf. ‘You do not know the real peril yet; but you shall. I was not sure of it&#13;
         myself when I was last here; but the time has come to speak. Give me the ring for a moment.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Frodo took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a chain that hung from his belt. He unfastened it and handed&#13;
         it slowly to the wizard. It felt suddenly very heavy, as if either it or Frodo himself was in some way reluctant for Gandalf&#13;
         to touch it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf held it up. It looked to be made of pure and solid gold. ‘Can you see any markings on it?’ he asked.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No,’ said Frodo. ‘There are none. It is quite plain, and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well then, look!’ To Frodo’s astonishment and distress the wizard threw it suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of&#13;
         the fire. Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs; but Gandalf held him back.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Wait!’ he said in a commanding voice, giving Frodo a quick look from under his bristling brows.</p>&#13;
      <p>No apparent change came over the ring. After a while Gandalf got up, closed the shutters outside the window, and drew the&#13;
         curtains. The room became dark and silent, though the clack of Sam’s shears, now nearer to the windows, could still be heard&#13;
         faintly from the garden. For a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire; then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth&#13;
         with the tongs, and at once picked it up. Frodo gasped.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is quite cool,’ said Gandalf. ‘Take it!’ Frodo received it on his shrinking palm: it seemed to have become thicker and&#13;
         heavier than ever.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hold it up!’ said Gandalf. ‘And look closely!’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page66"/>&#13;
      <p>As Frodo did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest pen-strokes, running along the ring, outside and inside: lines&#13;
         of fire that seemed to form the letters of a flowing script. They shone piercingly bright, and yet remote, as if out of a&#13;
         great depth.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="img"><img alt="art" src="images/Art_P066.jpg"/></p>&#13;
      <p>‘I cannot read the fiery letters,’ said Frodo in a quavering voice.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No,’ said Gandalf, ‘but I can. The letters are Elvish, of an ancient mode, but the language is that of Mordor, which I will&#13;
         not utter here. But this in the Common Tongue is what is said, close enough:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>It is only two lines of a verse long known in Elven-lore:</p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.’</em></p>&#13;
      <p>He paused, and then said slowly in a deep voice: ‘This is the Master-ring, the One Ring to rule them all. This is the One&#13;
         Ring that he lost many ages ago, to the great weakening &#13;
         <a id="page67"/>of his power. He greatly desires it – but he must <em>not</em> get it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo sat silent and motionless. Fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand, like a dark cloud rising in the East and looming&#13;
         up to engulf him. ‘This ring!’ he stammered. ‘How, how on earth did it come to me?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘Ah!’ said Gandalf. ‘That is a very long story. The beginnings lie back in the Black Years, which only the lore-masters now&#13;
         remember. If I were to tell you all that tale, we should still be sitting here when Spring had passed into Winter.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But last night I told you of Sauron the Great, the Dark Lord. The rumours that you have heard are true: he has indeed arisen&#13;
         again and left his hold in Mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor. That name even you hobbits&#13;
         have heard of, like a shadow on the borders of old stories. Always after a defeat and a respite, the Shadow takes another&#13;
         shape and grows again.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wish it need not have happened in my time,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘So do I,’ said Gandalf, ‘and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide&#13;
         is what to do with the time that is given us. And already, Frodo, our time is beginning to look black. The Enemy is fast becoming&#13;
         very strong. His plans are far from ripe, I think, but they are ripening. We shall be hard put to it. We should be very hard&#13;
         put to it, even if it were not for this dreadful chance.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Enemy still lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all resistance, break the last defences,&#13;
         and cover all the lands in a second darkness. He lacks the One Ring.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Three, fairest of all, the Elf-lords hid from him, and his hand never touched them or sullied them. Seven the Dwarf-kings&#13;
         possessed, but three he has recovered, and the others the dragons have consumed. Nine he gave to Mortal Men, proud and great,&#13;
         and so ensnared them. Long ago they fell under the dominion of the One, and they became Ringwraiths, shadows under his great&#13;
         Shadow, his most &#13;
         <a id="page68"/>terrible servants. Long ago. It is many a year since the Nine walked abroad. Yet who knows? As the Shadow grows once more,&#13;
         they too may walk again. But come! We will not speak of such things even in the morning of the Shire.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So it is now: the Nine he has gathered to himself; the Seven also, or else they are destroyed. The Three are hidden still.&#13;
         But that no longer troubles him. He only needs the One; for he made that Ring himself, it is his, and he let a great part&#13;
         of his own former power pass into it, so that he could rule all the others. If he recovers it, then he will command them all&#13;
         again, wherever they be, even the Three, and all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger&#13;
         than ever.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And this is the dreadful chance, Frodo. He believed that the One had perished; that the Elves had destroyed it, as should&#13;
         have been done. But he knows now that it has <em>not</em> perished, that it has been found. So he is seeking it, seeking it, and all his thought is bent on it. It is his great hope&#13;
         and our great fear.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Why, why wasn’t it destroyed?’ cried Frodo. ‘And how did the Enemy ever come to lose it, if he was so strong, and it was&#13;
         so precious to him?’ He clutched the Ring in his hand, as if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to seize it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was taken from him,’ said Gandalf. ‘The strength of the Elves to resist him was greater long ago; and not all Men were&#13;
         estranged from them. The Men of Westernesse came to their aid. That is a chapter of ancient history which it might be good&#13;
         to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and gathering dark, but great valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain.&#13;
         One day, perhaps, I will tell you all the tale, or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how this thing came to you, and that will be tale enough, this is&#13;
         all that I will say. It was Gil-galad, Elven-king and Elendil of Westernesse who overthrew Sauron, though they themselves&#13;
         perished in the deed; and Isildur Elendil’s son cut the Ring &#13;
         <a id="page69"/>from Sauron’s hand and took it for his own. Then Sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and was hidden for long years,&#13;
         until his shadow took shape again in Mirkwood.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But the Ring was lost. It fell into the Great River, Anduin, and vanished. For Isildur was marching north along the east&#13;
         banks of the River, and near the Gladden Fields he was waylaid by the Orcs of the Mountains, and almost all his folk were&#13;
         slain. He leaped into the waters, but the Ring slipped from his finger as he swam, and then the Orcs saw him and killed him&#13;
         with arrows.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf paused. ‘And there in the dark pools amid the Gladden Fields,’ he said, ‘the Ring passed out of knowledge and legend;&#13;
         and even so much of its history is known now only to a few, and the Council of the Wise could discover no more. But at last&#13;
         I can carry on the story, I think.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘Long after, but still very long ago, there lived by the banks of the Great River on the edge of Wilderland a clever-handed&#13;
         and quiet-footed little people. I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to the fathers of the fathers of the Stoors, for they&#13;
         loved the River, and often swam in it, or made little boats of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute, for it&#13;
         was large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as they&#13;
         had. The most inquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called Sméagol. He was interested in roots and beginnings;&#13;
         he dived into deep pools; he burrowed under trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look&#13;
         up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He had a friend called Déagol, of similar sort, sharper-eyed but not so quick and strong. On a time they took a boat and&#13;
         went down to the Gladden Fields, where there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds. There Sméagol got out and went nosing&#13;
         about the banks but Déagol sat in the boat and fished. Suddenly a great fish took his hook, and before he &#13;
         <a id="page70"/>knew where he was, he was dragged out and down into the water, to the bottom. Then he let go of his line, for he thought he&#13;
         saw something shining in the river-bed; and holding his breath he grabbed at it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then up he came spluttering, with weeds in his hair and a handful of mud; and he swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed&#13;
         the mud away, there in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it shone and glittered in the sun, so that his heart was&#13;
         glad. But Sméagol had been watching him from behind a tree, and as Déagol gloated over the ring, Sméagol came softly up behind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Give us that, Déagol, my love,” said Sméagol, over his friend’s shoulder.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Why?” said Déagol.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Because it’s my birthday, my love, and I wants it,” said Sméagol.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “I don’t care,” said Déagol. “I have given you a present already, more than I could afford. I found this, and I’m going&#13;
         to keep it.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Oh, are you indeed, my love,” said Sméagol; and he caught Déagol by the throat and strangled him, because the gold looked&#13;
         so bright and beautiful. Then he put the ring on his finger.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No one ever found out what had become of Déagol; he was murdered far from home, and his body was cunningly hidden. But Sméagol&#13;
         returned alone; and he found that none of his family could see him, when he was wearing the ring. He was very pleased with&#13;
         his discovery and he concealed it; and he used it to find out secrets, and he put his knowledge to crooked and malicious uses.&#13;
         He became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was hurtful. The ring had given him power according to his stature. It is&#13;
         not to be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when visible) by all his relations. They kicked him,&#13;
         and he bit their feet. He took to thieving, and going about muttering to himself, and gurgling in his throat. So they called&#13;
         him <em>Gollum</em>, and cursed him, and told him to go far away; and his grandmother, &#13;
         <a id="page71"/>desiring peace, expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He wandered in loneliness, weeping a little for the hardness of the world, and he journeyed up the River, till he came to&#13;
         a stream that flowed down from the mountains, and he went that way. He caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and&#13;
         ate them raw. One day it was very hot, and as he was bending over a pool, he felt a burning on the back of his head, and a&#13;
         dazzling light from the water pained his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he had almost forgotten about the Sun. Then for&#13;
         the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far ahead the tops of the Misty Mountains, out of which the stream came. And he thought&#13;
         suddenly: “It would be cool and shady under those mountains. The Sun could not watch me there. The roots of those mountains&#13;
         must be roots indeed; there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So he journeyed by night up into the highlands, and he found a little cave out of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed&#13;
         his way like a maggot into the heart of the hills, and vanished out of all knowledge. The Ring went into the shadows with&#13;
         him, and even the maker, when his power had begun to grow again, could learn nothing of it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘Gollum!’ cried Frodo. ‘Gollum? Do you mean that this is the very Gollum-creature that Bilbo met? How loathsome!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I think it is a sad story,’ said the wizard, ‘and it might have happened to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I can’t believe that Gollum was connected with hobbits, however distantly,’ said Frodo with some heat. ‘What an abominable&#13;
         notion!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is true all the same,’ replied Gandalf. ‘About their origins, at any rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves. And&#13;
         even Bilbo’s story suggests the kinship. There was a great deal in the background of their minds and memories &#13;
         <a id="page72"/>that was very similar. They understood one another remarkably well, very much better than a hobbit would understand, say,&#13;
         a Dwarf, or an Orc, or even an Elf. Think of the riddles they both knew, for one thing.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Frodo. ‘Though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles, and of much the same sort. And hobbits don’t cheat. Gollum&#13;
         meant to cheat all the time. He was just trying to put poor Bilbo off his guard. And I daresay it amused his wickedness to&#13;
         start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim, but if he lost would not hurt him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Only too true, I fear,’ said Gandalf. ‘But there was something else in it, I think, which you don’t see yet. Even Gollum&#13;
         was not wholly ruined. He had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed – as a hobbit might. There was a&#13;
         little corner of his mind that was still his own, and light came through it, as through a chink in the dark: light out of&#13;
         the past. It was actually pleasant, I think, to hear a kindly voice again, bringing up memories of wind, and trees, and sun&#13;
         on the grass, and such forgotten things.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrier in the end – unless it could be conquered. Unless it could&#13;
         be cured.’ Gandalf sighed. ‘Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not no hope. No, not though he possessed the Ring&#13;
         so long, almost as far back as he can remember. For it was long since he had worn it much: in the black darkness it was seldom&#13;
         needed. Certainly he had never “faded”. He is thin and tough still. But the thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the&#13;
         torment had become almost unbearable.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All the “great secrets” under the mountains had turned out to be just empty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothing&#13;
         worth doing, only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. He was altogether wretched. He hated the dark, and he hated&#13;
         light more: he hated everything, and the Ring most of all.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you mean?’ said Frodo. ‘Surely the Ring was his Precious and the only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why&#13;
         didn’t he get rid of it, or go away and leave it?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page73"/>‘You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,’ said Gandalf. ‘He hated it and loved it, as he hated&#13;
         and loved himself. He could not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘A Ring of Power looks after itself, Frodo. <em>It</em> may slip off treacherously, but its keeper never abandons it. At most he plays with the idea of handing it on to someone&#13;
         else’s care – and that only at an early stage, when it first begins to grip. But as far as I know Bilbo alone in history has&#13;
         ever gone beyond playing, and really done it. He needed all my help, too. And even so he would never have just forsaken it,&#13;
         or cast it aside. It was not Gollum, Frodo, but the Ring itself that decided things. The Ring left <em>him</em>.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What, just in time to meet Bilbo?’ said Frodo. ‘Wouldn’t an Orc have suited it better?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is no laughing matter,’ said Gandalf. ‘Not for you. It was the strangest event in the whole history of the Ring so far:&#13;
         Bilbo’s arrival just at that time, and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was trying to get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur’s&#13;
         hand and betrayed him; then when a chance came it caught poor Déagol, and he was murdered; and after that Gollum, and it had&#13;
         devoured him. It could make no further use of him: he was too small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never&#13;
         leave his deep pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, it&#13;
         abandoned Gollum. Only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the Ring-maker. I can put it no plainer than by saying&#13;
         that Bilbo was <em>meant</em> to find the Ring, and <em>not</em> by its maker. In which case you also were <em>meant</em> to have it. And that may be an encouraging thought.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is not,’ said Frodo. ‘Though I am not sure that I understand you. But how have you learned all this about the Ring, &#13;
         <a id="page74"/>and about Gollum? Do you really know it all, or are you just guessing still?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf looked at Frodo, and his eyes glinted. ‘I knew much and I have learned much,’ he answered. ‘But I am not going to&#13;
         give an account of all my doings to <em>you</em>. The history of Elendil and Isildur and the One Ring is known to all the Wise. Your ring is shown to be that One Ring by&#13;
         the fire-writing alone, apart from any other evidence.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And when did you discover that?’ asked Frodo, interrupting.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Just now in this room, of course,’ answered the wizard sharply. ‘But I expected to find it. I have come back from dark journeys&#13;
         and long search to make that final test. It is the last proof, and all is now only too clear. Making out Gollum’s part, and&#13;
         fitting it into the gap in the history, required some thought. I may have started with guesses about Gollum, but I am not&#13;
         guessing now. I know. I have seen him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You have seen Gollum?’ exclaimed Frodo in amazement.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes. The obvious thing to do, of course, if one could. I tried long ago; but I have managed it at last.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then what happened after Bilbo escaped from him? Do you know that?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to tell – though not, of course, in the way I have reported&#13;
         it. Gollum is a liar, and you have to sift his words. For instance, he called the Ring his “birthday-present”, and he stuck&#13;
         to that. He said it came from his grandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind. A ridiculous story. I have no&#13;
         doubt that Sméagol’s grandmother was a matriarch, a great person in her way, but to talk of her possessing many Elven-rings&#13;
         was absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. But a lie with a grain of truth.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The murder of Déagol haunted Gollum, and he had made up a defence, repeating it to his “Precious” over and over again, as&#13;
         he gnawed bones in the dark, until he almost believed it. It <em>was</em> his birthday. Déagol ought to have given the ring to him. It had obviously turned up just so as to be &#13;
         <a id="page75"/>a present. It <em>was</em> his birthday-present, and so on, and on.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desperately important, and in the end I had to be harsh. I put the fear&#13;
         of fire on him, and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with much snivelling and snarling. He thought he&#13;
         was misunderstood and ill-used. But when he had at last told me his history, as far as the end of the Riddle-game and Bilbo’s&#13;
         escape, he would not say any more, except in dark hints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he&#13;
         was going to get his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, and driven into a hole and then <em>robbed</em>. Gollum had good friends now, good friends and very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That was his chief&#13;
         thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name. What is more, he knew where he came from.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But how did he find that out?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, as for the name, Bilbo very foolishly told Gollum himself; and after that it would not be difficult to discover his&#13;
         country, once Gollum came out. Oh yes, he came out. His longing for the Ring proved stronger than his fear of the Orcs, or&#13;
         even of the light. After a year or two he left the mountains. You see, though still bound by desire of it, the Ring was no&#13;
         longer devouring him; he began to revive a little. He felt old, terribly old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Light, light of Sun and Moon, he still feared and hated, and he always will, I think; but he was cunning. He found he could&#13;
         hide from daylight and moonshine, and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of night with his pale cold eyes, and catch&#13;
         small frightened or unwary things. He grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air. He found his way into Mirkwood,&#13;
         as one would expect.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Is that where you found him?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I saw him there,’ answered Gandalf, ‘but before that he had wandered far, following Bilbo’s trail. It was difficult to learn&#13;
         anything from him for certain, for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats. “What had it got &#13;
         <a id="page76"/>in its pocketses?” he said. “It wouldn’t say, no precious. Little cheat. Not a fair question. It cheated first, it did. It&#13;
         broke the rules. We ought to have squeezed it, yes precious. And we will, precious!”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is a sample of his talk. I don’t suppose you want any more. I had weary days of it. But from hints dropped among the&#13;
         snarls I gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to Esgaroth, and even to the streets of Dale, listening secretly&#13;
         and peering. Well, the news of the great events went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo’s name and knew&#13;
         where he came from. We had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the West. Gollum’s sharp ears would soon learn&#13;
         what he wanted.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then why didn’t he track Bilbo further?’ asked Frodo. ‘Why didn’t he come to the Shire?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah,’ said Gandalf, ‘now we come to it. I think Gollum tried to. He set out and came back westward, as far as the Great River.&#13;
         But then he turned aside. He was not daunted by the distance, I am sure. No, something else drew him away. So my friends think,&#13;
         those that hunted him for me.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Wood-elves tracked him first, an easy task for them, for his trail was still fresh then. Through Mirkwood and back again&#13;
         it led them, though they never caught him. The wood was full of the rumour of him, dreadful tales even among beasts and birds.&#13;
         The Woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad, a ghost that drank blood. It climbed trees to find nests; it crept&#13;
         into holes to find the young; it slipped through windows to find cradles.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But at the western edge of Mirkwood the trail turned away. It wandered off southwards and passed out of the Wood-elves’ ken,&#13;
         and was lost. And then I made a great mistake. Yes, Frodo, and not the first; though I fear it may prove the worst. I let&#13;
         the matter be. I let him go; for I had much else to think of at that time, and I still trusted the lore of Saruman.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, that was years ago. I have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days. The trail was long cold when I &#13;
         <a id="page77"/>took it up again, after Bilbo left here. And my search would have been in vain, but for the help that I had from a friend:&#13;
         Aragorn, the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world. Together we sought for Gollum down the whole length&#13;
         of Wilderland, without hope, and without success. But at last, when I had given up the chase and turned to other paths, Gollum&#13;
         was found. My friend returned out of great perils bringing the miserable creature with him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept and called us cruel, with many a <em>gollum</em> in his throat; and when we pressed him he whined and cringed, and rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they pained&#13;
         him, as if he remembered some old torture. But I am afraid there is no possible doubt: he had made his slow, sneaking way,&#13;
         step by step, mile by mile, south, down at last to the Land of Mordor.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">A heavy silence fell in the room. Frodo could hear his heart beating. Even outside everything seemed still. No sound of Sam’s&#13;
         shears could now be heard.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, to Mordor,’ said Gandalf. ‘Alas! Mordor draws all wicked things, and the Dark Power was bending all its will to gather&#13;
         them there. The Ring of the Enemy would leave its mark, too, leave him open to the summons. And all folk were whispering then&#13;
         of the new Shadow in the South, and its hatred of the West. There were his fine new friends, who would help him in his revenge!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his comfort. And sooner or later as he lurked and pried on&#13;
         the borders he would be caught, and taken – for examination. That was the way of it, I fear. When he was found he had already&#13;
         been there long, and was on his way back. On some errand of mischief. But that does not matter much now. His worst mischief&#13;
         was done.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the One has been found again. He knows where Isildur fell. He knows where&#13;
         Gollum found his ring. He knows that it is a Great Ring, for it gave long life. He knows that it is not one &#13;
         <a id="page78"/>of the Three, for they have never been lost, and they endure no evil. He knows that it is not one of the Seven, or the Nine,&#13;
         for they are accounted for. He knows that it is the One. And he has at last heard, I think, of <em>hobbits</em> and the <em>Shire</em>.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Shire – he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already found out where it lies. Indeed, Frodo, I fear that he may&#13;
         even think that the long-unnoticed name of <em>Baggins</em> has become important.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But this is terrible!’ cried Frodo. ‘Far worse than the worst that I imagined from your hints and warnings. O Gandalf, best&#13;
         of friends, what am I to do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What a pity that Bilbo did not stab that vile creature,&#13;
         when he had a chance!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need. And he has been well rewarded, Frodo.&#13;
         Be sure that he took so little hurt from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the Ring so.&#13;
         With Pity.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am sorry,’ said Frodo. ‘But I am frightened; and I do not feel any pity for Gollum.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You have not seen him,’ Gandalf broke in.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, and I don’t want to,’ said Frodo. ‘I can’t understand you. Do you mean to say that you, and the Elves, have let him live&#13;
         on after all those horrible deeds? Now at any rate he is as bad as an Orc, and just an enemy. He deserves death.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then&#13;
         do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that&#13;
         Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells&#13;
         me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the&#13;
         fate of many – yours not least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The Wood-elves have him&#13;
         in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page79"/>‘All the same,’ said Frodo, ‘even if Bilbo could not kill Gollum, I wish he had not kept the Ring. I wish he had never found&#13;
         it, and that I had not got it! Why did you let me keep it? Why didn’t you make me throw it away, or, or destroy it?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Let you? Make you?’ said the wizard. ‘Haven’t you been listening to all that I have said? You are not thinking of what you&#13;
         are saying. But as for throwing it away, that was obviously wrong. These Rings have a way of being found. In evil hands it&#13;
         might have done great evil. Worst of all, it might have fallen into the hands of the Enemy. Indeed it certainly would; for&#13;
         this is the One, and he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of course, my dear Frodo, it was dangerous for you; and that has troubled me deeply. But there was so much at stake that&#13;
         I had to take some risk – though even when I was far away there has never been a day when the Shire has not been guarded by&#13;
         watchful eyes. As long as you never used it, I did not think that the Ring would have any lasting effect on you, not for evil,&#13;
         not at any rate for a very long time. And you must remember that nine years ago, when I last saw you, I still knew little&#13;
         for certain.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But why not destroy it, as you say should have been done long ago?’ cried Frodo again. ‘If you had warned me, or even sent&#13;
         me a message, I would have done away with it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Would you? How would you do that? Have you ever tried?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No. But I suppose one could hammer it or melt it.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Try!’ said Gandalf. ‘Try now!’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Frodo drew the Ring out of his pocket again and looked at it. It now appeared plain and smooth, without mark or device that&#13;
         he could see. The gold looked very fair and pure, and Frodo thought how rich and beautiful was its colour, how perfect was&#13;
         its roundness. It was an admirable thing and altogether precious. When he took it out he had intended to fling it from him&#13;
         into the very hottest part of the fire. But he found now that he could not do so, not without a great struggle. He weighed&#13;
         the Ring in his hand, hesitating, and &#13;
         <a id="page80"/>forcing himself to remember all that Gandalf had told him; and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast&#13;
         it away – but he found that he had put it back in his pocket.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf laughed grimly. ‘You see? Already you too, Frodo, cannot easily let it go, nor will to damage it. And I could not&#13;
         “make” you – except by force, which would break your mind. But as for breaking the Ring, force is useless. Even if you took&#13;
         it and struck it with a heavy sledge-hammer, it would make no dint in it. It cannot be unmade by your hands, or by mine.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This Ring has already passed through it unscathed, and even&#13;
         unheated. But there is no smith’s forge in this Shire that could change it at all. Not even the anvils and furnaces of the&#13;
         Dwarves could do that. It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any&#13;
         dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who&#13;
         could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is only one way: to find the Cracks of Doom in the depths of Orodruin, the Fire-mountain, and cast the Ring in there,&#13;
         if you really wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy for ever.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do really wish to destroy it!’ cried Frodo. ‘Or, well, to have it destroyed. I am not made for perilous quests. I wish&#13;
         I had never seen the Ring! Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Such questions cannot be answered,’ said Gandalf. ‘You may be sure that it was not for any merit that others do not possess:&#13;
         not for power or wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you must therefore use such strength and heart and wits&#13;
         as you have.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and powerful. Will you not take the Ring?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No!’ cried Gandalf, springing to his feet. ‘With that power &#13;
         <a id="page81"/>I should have power too great and terrible. And over me the Ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly.’ His eyes&#13;
         flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within. ‘Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark Lord himself.&#13;
         Yet the way of the Ring to my heart is by pity, pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good. Do not tempt me!&#13;
         I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too great for my strength. I shall have&#13;
         such need of it. Great perils lie before me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters. Sunlight streamed back again into the room. Sam passed&#13;
         along the path outside whistling. ‘And now,’ said the wizard, turning back to Frodo, ‘the decision lies with you. But I will&#13;
         always help you.’ He laid his hand on Frodo’s shoulder. ‘I will help you bear this burden, as long as it is yours to bear.&#13;
         But we must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">There was a long silence. Gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe, as if lost in thought. His eyes seemed closed, but&#13;
         under the lids he was watching Frodo intently. Frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth, until they filled all&#13;
         his vision, and he seemed to be looking down into profound wells of fire. He was thinking of the fabled Cracks of Doom and&#13;
         the terror of the Fiery Mountain.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well!’ said Gandalf at last. ‘What are you thinking about? Have you decided what to do?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No!’ answered Frodo, coming back to himself out of darkness, and finding to his surprise that it was not dark, and that out&#13;
         of the window he could see the sunlit garden. ‘Or perhaps, yes. As far as I understand what you have said, I suppose I must&#13;
         keep the Ring and guard it, at least for the present, whatever it may do to me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with that purpose,’ said Gandalf.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I hope so,’ said Frodo. ‘But I hope that you may find some other better keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it seems that &#13;
         <a id="page82"/>I am a danger, a danger to all that live near me. I cannot keep the Ring and stay here. I ought to leave Bag End, leave the&#13;
         Shire, leave everything and go away.’ He sighed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I should like to save the Shire, if I could – though there have been times when I thought the inhabitants too stupid and&#13;
         dull for words, and have felt that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them. But I don’t feel like that&#13;
         now. I feel that as long as the Shire lies behind, safe and comfortable, I shall find wandering more bearable: I shall know&#13;
         that somewhere there is a firm foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that as a kind of holiday, a series of adventures like&#13;
         Bilbo’s or better, ending in peace. But this would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, drawing it after me. And&#13;
         I suppose I must go alone, if I am to do that and save the Shire. But I feel very small, and very uprooted, and well – desperate.&#13;
         The Enemy is so strong and terrible.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He did not tell Gandalf, but as he was speaking a great desire to follow Bilbo flamed up in his heart – to follow Bilbo, and&#13;
         even perhaps to find him again. It was so strong that it overcame his fear: he could almost have run out there and then down&#13;
         the road without his hat, as Bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘My dear Frodo!’ exclaimed Gandalf. ‘Hobbits really are amazing creatures, as I have said before. You can learn all that there&#13;
         is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pinch. I hardly expected&#13;
         to get such an answer, not even from you. But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though he little thought how important&#13;
         it would prove. I am afraid you are right. The Ring will not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much longer; and for your&#13;
         own sake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave the name of Baggins behind you. That name will not be safe&#13;
         to have, outside the Shire or in the Wild. I will give you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr. Underhill.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page83"/>‘But I don’t think you need go alone. Not if you know of anyone you can trust, and who would be willing to go by your side&#13;
         – and that you would be willing to take into unknown perils. But if you look for a companion, be careful in choosing! And&#13;
         be careful of what you say, even to your closest friends! The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly he stopped as if listening. Frodo became aware that all was very quiet, inside and outside. Gandalf crept to one&#13;
         side of the window. Then with a dart he sprang to the sill, and thrust a long arm out and downwards. There was a squawk, and&#13;
         up came Sam Gamgee’s curly head hauled by one ear.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, well, bless my beard!’ said Gandalf. ‘Sam Gamgee is it? Now what may you be doing?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Lor bless you, Mr. Gandalf, sir!’ said Sam. ‘Nothing! Leastways I was just trimming the grass-border under the window, if&#13;
         you follow me.’ He picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t,’ said Gandalf grimly. ‘It is some time since I last heard the sound of your shears. How long have you been eavesdropping?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Eavesdropping, sir? I don’t follow you, begging your pardon. There ain’t no eaves at Bag End, and that’s a fact.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Don’t be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you listen?’ Gandalf ’s eyes flashed and his brows stuck out like bristles.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Mr. Frodo, sir!’ cried Sam quaking. ‘Don’t let him hurt me, sir! Don’t let him turn me into anything unnatural! My old dad&#13;
         would take on so. I meant no harm, on my honour, sir!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He won’t hurt you,’ said Frodo, hardly able to keep from laughing, although he was himself startled and rather puzzled. ‘He&#13;
         knows, as well as I do, that you mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight away!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, sir,’ said Sam dithering a little. ‘I heard a deal that I didn’t rightly understand, about an enemy, and rings, and&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page84"/>Mr. Bilbo, sir, and dragons, and a fiery mountain, and – and Elves, sir. I listened because I couldn’t help myself, if you&#13;
         know what I mean. Lor bless me, sir, but I do love tales of that sort. And I believe them too, whatever Ted may say. Elves,&#13;
         sir! I would dearly love to see <em>them.</em> Couldn’t you take me to see Elves, sir, when you go?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly Gandalf laughed. ‘Come inside!’ he shouted, and putting out both his arms he lifted the astonished Sam, shears, grass-clippings&#13;
         and all, right through the window and stood him on the floor. ‘Take you to see Elves, eh?’ he said, eyeing Sam closely, but&#13;
         with a smile flickering on his face. ‘So you heard that Mr. Frodo is going away?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I did, sir. And that’s why I choked: which you heard seemingly. I tried not to, sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It can’t be helped, Sam,’ said Frodo sadly. He had suddenly realized that flying from the Shire would mean more painful partings&#13;
         than merely saying farewell to the familiar comforts of Bag End. ‘I shall have to go. But’ – and here he looked hard at Sam&#13;
         – ‘if you really care about me, you will keep that <em>dead</em> secret. See? If you don’t, if you even breathe a word of what you’ve heard here, then I hope Gandalf will turn you into a&#13;
         spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass-snakes.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam fell on his knees, trembling. ‘Get up, Sam!’ said Gandalf. ‘I have thought of something better than that. Something to&#13;
         shut your mouth, and punish you properly for listening. You shall go away with Mr. Frodo!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Me, sir!’ cried Sam, springing up like a dog invited for a walk. ‘Me go and see Elves and all! Hooray!’ he shouted, and then&#13;
         burst into tears.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-3">THREE IS COMPANY</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">‘You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,’ said Gandalf. Two or three weeks had passed, and still Frodo made no&#13;
         sign of getting ready to go.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I know. But it is difficult to do both,’ he objected. ‘If I just vanish like Bilbo, the tale will be all over the Shire in&#13;
         no time.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of course you mustn’t vanish!’ said Gandalf. ‘That wouldn’t do at all! I said <em>soon</em>, not <em>instantly.</em> If you can think of any way of slipping out of the Shire without its being generally known, it will be worth a little delay.&#13;
         But you must not delay too long.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What about the autumn, on or after Our Birthday?’ asked Frodo. ‘I think I could probably make some arrangements by then.’</p>&#13;
      <p>To tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come to the point: Bag End seemed a more desirable residence&#13;
         than it had for years, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the Shire. When autumn came, he knew&#13;
         that part at least of his heart would think more kindly of journeying, as it always did at that season. He had indeed privately&#13;
         made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo’s one hundred and twenty-eighth. It seemed somehow the proper day&#13;
         on which to set out and follow him. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and the one thing that made the thought of&#13;
         leaving bearable. He thought as little as possible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in the end. But he did not&#13;
         tell all his thoughts to Gandalf. What the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He looked at Frodo and smiled. ‘Very well,’ he said. ‘I think that will do – but it must not be any later. I am getting very&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page86"/>anxious. In the meanwhile, do take care, and don’t let out any hint of where you are going! And see that Sam Gamgee does not&#13;
         talk. If he does, I really shall turn him into a toad.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘As for <em>where</em> I am going,’ said Frodo, ‘it would be difficult to give that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Don’t be absurd!’ said Gandalf. ‘I am not warning you against leaving an address at the post-office! But you are leaving&#13;
         the Shire – and that should not be known, until you are far away. And you must go, or at least set out, either North, South,&#13;
         West or East – and the direction should certainly not be known.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving Bag End, and of saying farewell, that I have never even considered the&#13;
         direction,’ said Frodo. ‘For where am I to go? And by what shall I steer? What is to be my quest? Bilbo went to find a treasure,&#13;
         there and back again; but I go to lose one, and not return, as far as I can see.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But you cannot see very far,’ said Gandalf. ‘Neither can</p>&#13;
      <p>I. It may be your task to find the Cracks of Doom; but that quest may be for others: I do not know. At any rate you are not&#13;
         ready for that long road yet.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No indeed!’ said Frodo. ‘But in the meantime what course am I to take?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Towards danger; but not too rashly, nor too straight,’ answered the wizard. ‘If you want my advice, make for Rivendell. That&#13;
         journey should not prove too perilous, though the Road is less easy than it was, and it will grow worse as the year fails.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Rivendell!’ said Frodo. ‘Very good: I will go east, and I will make for Rivendell. I will take Sam to visit the Elves; he&#13;
         will be delighted.’ He spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the house of Elrond Halfelven,&#13;
         and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the Fair Folk still dwelt in peace.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">One summer’s evening an astonishing piece of news reached the <em>Ivy Bush</em> and <em>Green Dragon.</em> Giants and other &#13;
         <a id="page87"/>portents on the borders of the Shire were forgotten for more important matters: Mr. Frodo was selling Bag End, indeed he had&#13;
         already sold it – to the Sackville-Bagginses!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘For a nice bit, too,’ said some. ‘At a bargain price,’ said others, ‘and that’s more likely when Mistress Lobelia’s the buyer.’&#13;
         (Otho had died some years before, at the ripe but disappointed age of 102.)&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Just why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable than the price. A few held the theory – supported&#13;
         by the nods and hints of Mr. Baggins himself – that Frodo’s money was running out: he was going to leave Hobbiton and live&#13;
         in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations. ‘As far from the Sackville-Bagginses&#13;
         as may be,’ some added. But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that&#13;
         most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested&#13;
         a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day, it was well known&#13;
         that he was ‘hiding up in the Bag End’. But however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was no&#13;
         doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, I shall be moving this autumn,’ he said. ‘Merry Brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps&#13;
         a small house.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As a matter of fact with Merry’s help he had already chosen and bought a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond&#13;
         Bucklebury. To all but Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently. The decision to set out eastwards had&#13;
         suggested the idea to him; for Buckland was on the eastern borders of the Shire, and as he had lived there in childhood his&#13;
         going back would at least seem credible.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Gandalf stayed in the Shire for over two months. Then one evening, at the end of June, soon after Frodo’s plan had been &#13;
         <a id="page88"/>finally arranged, he suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning. ‘Only for a short while, I hope,’ he said.&#13;
         ‘But I am going down beyond the southern borders to get some news, if I can. I have been idle longer than I should.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked rather worried. ‘Has anything happened?’ he asked.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs looking into. If I think it necessary after all for&#13;
         you to get off at once, I shall come back immediately, or at least send word. In the meanwhile stick to your plan; but be&#13;
         more careful than ever, especially of the Ring. Let me impress on you once more: <em>don’t use it!</em>’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He went off at dawn. ‘I may be back any day,’ he said. ‘At the very latest I shall come back for the farewell party. I think&#13;
         after all you may need my company on the Road.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and&#13;
         in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while. The Shire had seldom seen so fair a summer, or so rich an autumn:&#13;
         the trees were laden with apples, honey was dripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf again. September was passing and there was still no news&#13;
         of him. The Birthday, and the removal, drew nearer, and still he did not come, or send word. Bag End began to be busy. Some&#13;
         of Frodo’s friends came to stay and help him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and of course his&#13;
         special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between them they turned the whole place upside-down.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>On September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland, conveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold&#13;
         to his new home, by way of the Brandywine Bridge.The next day Frodo became really anxious, and kept a constant look-out for&#13;
         Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning, dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for Bilbo’s great party. Still Gandalf&#13;
         did not appear. In the &#13;
         <a id="page89"/>evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was quite small, just a dinner for himself and his four helpers; but he was troubled&#13;
         and felt in no mood for it. The thought that he would so soon have to part with his young friends weighed on his heart. He&#13;
         wondered how he would break it to them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The four younger hobbits were, however, in high spirits, and the party soon became very cheerful in spite of Gandalf ’s absence.&#13;
         The dining-room was bare except for a table and chairs, but the food was good, and there was good wine: Frodo’s wine had not&#13;
         been included in the sale to the Sackville-Bagginses.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff, when the S.-B.s get their claws on it, at any rate I have found a good home for&#13;
         this!’ said Frodo, as he drained his glass. It was the last drop of Old Winyards.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When they had sung many songs, and talked of many things they had done together, they toasted Bilbo’s birthday, and they drank&#13;
         his health and Frodo’s together according to Frodo’s custom. Then they went out for a sniff of air, and glimpse of the stars,&#13;
         and then they went to bed. Frodo’s party was over, and Gandalf had not come.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The next morning they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the luggage. Merry took charge of this, and drove&#13;
         off with Fatty (that is Fredegar Bolger). ‘Someone must get there and warm the house before you arrive,’ said Merry. ‘Well,&#13;
         see you later – the day after tomorrow, if you don’t go to sleep on the way!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Folco went home after lunch, but Pippin remained behind. Frodo was restless and anxious, listening in vain for a sound of&#13;
         Gandalf. He decided to wait until nightfall. After that, if Gandalf wanted him urgently, he would go to Crickhollow, and might&#13;
         even get there first. For Frodo was going on foot. His plan – for pleasure and a last look at the Shire as much as any other&#13;
         reason – was to walk from Hobbiton to Bucklebury Ferry, taking it fairly easy.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I shall get myself a bit into training, too,’ he said, looking &#13;
         <a id="page90"/>at himself in a dusty mirror in the half-empty hall. He had not done any strenuous walking for a long time, and the reflection&#13;
         looked rather flabby, he thought.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son, Lotho, turned up, much to Frodo’s annoyance. ‘Ours&#13;
         at last!’ said Lobelia, as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of Bag End did not take&#13;
         effect until midnight. But Lobelia can perhaps be forgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventy-seven years longer&#13;
         for Bag End than she once hoped, and she was now a hundred years old. Anyway, she had come to see that nothing she had paid&#13;
         for had been carried off; and she wanted the keys. It took a long while to satisfy her, as she had brought a complete inventory&#13;
         with her and went right through it. In the end she departed with Lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key&#13;
         would be left at the Gamgees’ in Bagshot Row. She snorted, and showed plainly that she thought the Gamgees capable of plundering&#13;
         the hole during the night. Frodo did not offer her any tea.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the kitchen. It had been officially announced that Sam was coming to Buckland&#13;
         ‘to do for Mr. Frodo and look after his bit of garden’; an arrangement that was approved by the Gaffer, though it did not&#13;
         console him for the prospect of having Lobelia as a neighbour.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Our last meal at Bag End!’ said Frodo, pushing back his chair. They left the washing up for Lobelia. Pippin and Sam strapped&#13;
         up their three packs and piled them in the porch. Pippin went out for a last stroll in the garden. Sam disappeared.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. Frodo wandered round the familiar rooms, and saw the light&#13;
         of the sunset fade on the walls, and shadows creep out of the corners. It grew slowly dark indoors. He went out and walked&#13;
         down to the gate at the bottom of the path, and then on a short way down the Hill Road. He half &#13;
         <a id="page91"/>expected to see Gandalf come striding up through the dusk.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. ‘It’s going to be a fine night,’ he said aloud. ‘That’s good for a beginning.&#13;
         I feel like walking. I can’t bear any more hanging about. I am going to start, and Gandalf must follow me.’ He turned to go&#13;
         back, and then stopped, for he heard voices, just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row. One voice was certainly the&#13;
         old Gaffer’s; the other was strange, and somehow unpleasant. He could not make out what it said, but he heard the Gaffer’s&#13;
         answers, which were rather shrill. The old man seemed put out.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, Mr. Baggins has gone away. Went this morning, and my Sam went with him: anyway all his stuff went. Yes, sold out and&#13;
         gone, I tell’ee. Why? Why’s none of my business, or yours. Where to? That ain’t no secret. He’s moved to Bucklebury or some&#13;
         such place, away down yonder. Yes it is – a tidy way. I’ve never been so far myself; they’re queer folks in Buckland. No,&#13;
         I can’t give no message. Good night to you!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Footsteps went away down the Hill. Frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that they did not come on up the Hill seemed a great&#13;
         relief. ‘I am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings, I suppose,’ he thought. ‘What an inquisitive lot they all are!’&#13;
         He had half a mind to go and ask the Gaffer who the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and walked&#13;
         quickly back to Bag End.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch. Sam was not there. Frodo stepped inside the dark door. ‘Sam!’ he called. ‘Sam!&#13;
         Time!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Coming, sir!’ came the answer from far within, followed soon by Sam himself, wiping his mouth. He had been saying farewell&#13;
         to the beer-barrel in the cellar.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All aboard, Sam?’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, sir. I’ll last for a bit now, sir.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to Sam. ‘Run down with this to your home, Sam!’ he said. ‘Then cut&#13;
         along the Row and meet us as quick as you can at &#13;
         <a id="page92"/>the gate in the lane beyond the meadows. We are not going through the village tonight. Too many ears pricking and eyes prying.’&#13;
         Sam ran off at full speed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, now we’re off at last!’ said Frodo. They shouldered their packs and took up their sticks, and walked round the corner&#13;
         to the west side of Bag End. ‘Good-bye!’ said Frodo, looking at the dark blank windows. He waved his hand, and then turned&#13;
         and (following Bilbo, if he had known it) hurried after Peregrin down the garden-path. They jumped over the low place in the&#13;
         hedge at the bottom and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane. There they halted and adjusted&#13;
         the straps of their packs. Presently Sam appeared, trotting quickly and breathing hard; his heavy pack was hoisted high on&#13;
         his shoulders, and he had put on his head a tall shapeless felt bag, which he called a hat. In the gloom he looked very much&#13;
         like a dwarf.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,’ said Frodo. ‘I pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their&#13;
         backs.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,’ said Sam stoutly and untruthfully.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No you don’t, Sam!’ said Pippin. ‘It is good for him. He’s got nothing except what he ordered us to pack. He’s been slack&#13;
         lately, and he’ll feel the weight less when he’s walked off some of his own.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Be kind to a poor old hobbit!’ laughed Frodo. ‘I shall be as thin as a willow-wand, I’m sure, before I get to Buckland. But&#13;
         I was talking nonsense. I suspect you have taken more than your share, Sam, and I shall look into it at our next packing.’&#13;
         He picked up his stick again. ‘Well, we all like walking in the dark,’ he said, ‘so let’s put some miles behind us before&#13;
         bed.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>For a short way they followed the lane westwards. Then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to the fields again. &#13;
         <a id="page93"/>They went in single file along hedgerows and the borders of coppices, and night fell dark about them. In their dark cloaks&#13;
         they were as invisible as if they all had magic rings. Since they were all hobbits, and were trying to be silent, they made&#13;
         no noise that even hobbits would hear. Even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow plank-bridge. The stream was there no more than a winding&#13;
         black ribbon, bordered with leaning alder-trees. A mile or two further south they hastily crossed the great road from the&#13;
         Brandywine Bridge; they were now in the Tookland and bending south-eastwards they made for the Green Hill Country. As they&#13;
         began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the&#13;
         Water. Soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land, and was followed by Bywater beside its grey pool. When the light&#13;
         of the last farm was far behind, peeping among the trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,’ he said quietly.</p>&#13;
      <p>When they had walked for about three hours they rested. The night was clear, cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist&#13;
         were creeping up the hill-sides from the streams and deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying in a light wind above their&#13;
         heads, made a black net against the pale sky. They ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), and then went on again. Soon they&#13;
         struck a narrow road, that went rolling up and down, fading grey into the darkness ahead: the road to Woodhall, and Stock,&#13;
         and the Bucklebury Ferry. It climbed away from the main road in the Water-valley, and wound over the skirts of the Green Hills&#13;
         towards Woody End, a wild corner of the Eastfarthing.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night. It was&#13;
         very dark. At first they talked, or hummed a tune softly together, being now far away from inquisitive ears. Then they &#13;
         <a id="page94"/>marched on in silence, and Pippin began to lag behind. At last, as they began to climb a steep slope, he stopped and yawned.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am so sleepy,’ he said, ‘that soon I shall fall down on the road. Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly midnight.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I thought you liked walking in the dark,’ said Frodo. ‘But there is no great hurry. Merry expects us some time the day after&#13;
         tomorrow; but that leaves us nearly two days more. We’ll halt at the first likely spot.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The wind’s in the West,’ said Sam. ‘If we get to the other side of this hill, we shall find a spot that is sheltered and&#13;
         snug enough, sir. There is a dry fir-wood just ahead, if I remember rightly.’ Sam knew the land well within twenty miles of&#13;
         Hobbiton, but that was the limit of his geography.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood. Leaving the road they went into the deep resin-scented darkness&#13;
         of the trees, and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire. Soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large&#13;
         fir-tree and they sat round it for a while, until they began to nod. Then, each in an angle of the great tree’s roots, they&#13;
         curled up in their cloaks and blankets, and were soon fast asleep. They set no watch; even Frodo feared no danger yet, for&#13;
         they were still in the heart of the Shire. A few creatures came and looked at them when the fire had died away. A fox passing&#13;
         through the wood on business of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hobbits!’ he thought. ‘Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings in this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit&#13;
         sleeping out of doors under a tree. Three of them! There’s something mighty queer behind this.’ He was quite right, but he&#13;
         never found out any more about it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The morning came, pale and clammy. Frodo woke up first, and found that a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his&#13;
         neck was stiff. ‘Walking for pleasure! Why didn’t I drive?’ he thought, as he usually did at the beginning of an &#13;
         <a id="page95"/>expedition. ‘And all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the Sackville-Bagginses! These tree-roots would do them good.’&#13;
         He stretched. ‘Wake up, hobbits!’ he cried. ‘It’s a beautiful morning.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What’s beautiful about it?’ said Pippin, peering over the edge of his blanket with one eye. ‘Sam! Get breakfast ready for&#13;
         half-past nine! Have you got the bath-water hot?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam jumped up, looking rather bleary. ‘No, sir, I haven’t, sir!’ he said.</p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo stripped the blankets from Pippin and rolled him over, and then walked off to the edge of the wood. Away eastward the&#13;
         sun was rising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world. Touched with gold and red the autumn trees seemed to be sailing&#13;
         rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow and disappeared.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When he returned Sam and Pippin had got a good fire going. ‘Water!’ shouted Pippin. ‘Where’s the water?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t keep water in my pockets,’ said Frodo. ‘We thought you had gone to find some,’ said Pippin, busy setting out the&#13;
         food, and cups. ‘You had better go now.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You can come too,’ said Frodo, ‘and bring all the waterbottles.’ There was a stream at the foot of the hill. They filled&#13;
         their bottles and the small camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell a few feet over an outcrop of grey stone.&#13;
         It was icy cold; and they spluttered and puffed as they bathed their faces and hands.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it was after ten o’clock, and the day was beginning to&#13;
         turn fine and hot. They went down the slope, and across the stream where it dived under the road, and up the next slope, and&#13;
         up and down another shoulder of the hills; and by that time their cloaks, blankets, water, food, and other gear already seemed&#13;
         a heavy burden.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The day’s march promised to be warm and tiring work. After some miles, however, the road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed&#13;
         to the top of a steep bank in a weary &#13;
         <a id="page96"/>zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to go down for the last time. In front of them they saw the lower lands dotted&#13;
         with small clumps of trees that melted away in the distance to a brown woodland haze. They were looking across the Woody End&#13;
         towards the Brandywine River. The road wound away before them like a piece of string.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The road goes on for ever,’ said Pippin; ‘but I can’t without a rest. It is high time for lunch.’ He sat down on the bank&#13;
         at the side of the road and looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay the River, and the end of the Shire in which&#13;
         he had spent all his life. Sam stood by him. His round eyes were wide open – for he was looking across lands he had never&#13;
         seen to a new horizon.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do Elves live in those woods?’ he asked.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not that I ever heard,’ said Pippin. Frodo was silent. He too was gazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen&#13;
         it before. Suddenly he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>The Road goes ever on and on</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Down from the door where it began.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Now far ahead the Road has gone,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>And I must follow, if I can,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Pursuing it with weary feet,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Until it joins some larger way,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Where many paths and errands meet.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>And whither then? I cannot say.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>‘That sounds like a bit of old Bilbo’s rhyming,’ said Pippin. ‘Or is it one of your imitations? It does not sound altogether&#13;
         encouraging.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo. ‘It came to me then, as if I was making it up; but I may have heard it long ago. Certainly it&#13;
         reminds me very much of Bilbo in the last years, before he went away. He used often to say there was only one Road; that it&#13;
         was like a great river: its springs were at every doorstep, and every path was its tributary. “It’s a dangerous business,&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page97"/>Frodo, going out of your door,” he used to say. “You step into the Road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there is no knowing&#13;
         where you might be swept off to. Do you realize that this is the very path that goes through Mirkwood, and that if you let&#13;
         it, it might take you to the Lonely Mountain or even further and to worse places?” He used to say that on the path outside&#13;
         the front door at Bag End, especially after he had been out for a long walk.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, the Road won’t sweep me anywhere for an hour at least,’ said Pippin, unslinging his pack. The others followed his example,&#13;
         putting their packs against the bank and their legs out into the road. After a rest they had a good lunch, and then more rest.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as they went down the hill. So far they had not&#13;
         met a soul on the road. This way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little traffic to the Woody&#13;
         End. They had been jogging along again for an hour or more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening. They were now on level&#13;
         ground, and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching&#13;
         woods.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,’ said Sam.</p>&#13;
      <p>They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far. ‘I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us,’&#13;
         said Frodo; but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the&#13;
         rider came over him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It may not matter much,’ he said apologetically, ‘but I would rather not be seen on the road – by anyone. I am sick of my&#13;
         doings being noticed and discussed. And if it is Gandalf,’ he added as an afterthought, ‘we can give him a little surprise,&#13;
         to pay him out for being so late. Let’s get out of sight!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little &#13;
         <a id="page98"/>hollow not far from the road. There they lay flat. Frodo hesitated for a second: curiosity or some other feeling was struggling&#13;
         with his desire to hide. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind&#13;
         a tree that overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Round the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-sized horse; and on it sat a large man, who seemed to crouch&#13;
         in the saddle, wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only his boots in the high stirrups showed below; his face&#13;
         was shadowed and invisible.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When it reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped. The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed,&#13;
         as if listening. From inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent; the head turned from&#13;
         side to side of the road.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, and he thought of his Ring. He hardly dared to breathe, and yet&#13;
         the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand. He felt that he had only to&#13;
         slip it on, and then he would be safe. The advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used the Ring. ‘And I am still in the&#13;
         Shire,’ he thought, as his hand touched the chain on which it hung. At that moment the rider sat up, and shook the reins.&#13;
         The horse stepped forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider, until he dwindled into the distance. He could not be quite sure,&#13;
         but it seemed to him that suddenly, before it passed out of sight, the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,’ said Frodo to himself, as he walked towards his companions. Pippin&#13;
         and Sam had remained flat in the grass, and had seen nothing; so Frodo described the rider and his strange behaviour.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page99"/>‘I can’t say why, but I felt certain he was looking or <em>smelling</em> for me; and also I felt certain that I did not want him to discover me. I’ve never seen or felt anything like it in the Shire&#13;
         before.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But what has one of the Big People got to do with us?’ said Pippin. ‘And what is he doing in this part of the world?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘There are some Men about,’ said Frodo. ‘Down in the Southfarthing they have had trouble with Big People, I believe. But I&#13;
         have never heard of anything like this rider. I wonder where he comes from.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Begging your pardon,’ put in Sam suddenly, ‘I know where he comes from. It’s from Hobbiton that this here black rider comes,&#13;
         unless there’s more than one. And I know where he’s going to.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you mean?’ said Frodo sharply, looking at him in astonishment. ‘Why didn’t you speak up before?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to our hole yesterday evening with the key, my dad, he&#13;
         says to me: <em>Hallo, Sam!</em> he says. <em>I thought you were away with Mr. Frodo this morning. There’s been a strange customer asking for Mr. Baggins of Bag End, and&#13;
            he’s only just gone. I’ve sent him on to Bucklebury. Not that I liked the sound of him. He seemed mighty put out, when I told&#13;
            him Mr. Baggins had left his old home for good. Hissed at me, he did. It gave me quite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was&#13;
            he?</em> says I to the Gaffer. <em>I don’t know</em>, says he; <em>but he wasn’t a hobbit. He was tall and black-like, and he stooped over me. I reckon it was one of the Big Folk from foreign&#13;
            parts. He spoke funny.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>‘I couldn’t stay to hear more, sir, since you were waiting; and I didn’t give much heed to it myself. The Gaffer is getting&#13;
         old, and more than a bit blind, and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the Hill and found him taking the&#13;
         air at the end of our Row. I hope he hasn’t done no harm, sir, nor me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Gaffer can’t be blamed anyway,’ said Frodo. ‘As a matter of fact I heard him talking to a stranger, who seemed to be&#13;
         inquiring for me, and I nearly went and asked him who &#13;
         <a id="page100"/>it was. I wish I had, or you had told me about it before. I might have been more careful on the road.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Still, there may be no connexion between this rider and the Gaffer’s stranger,’ said Pippin. ‘We left Hobbiton secretly enough,&#13;
         and I don’t see how he could have followed us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What about the <em>smelling</em>, sir?’ said Sam. ‘And the Gaffer said he was a black chap.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wish I had waited for Gandalf,’ Frodo muttered. ‘But perhaps it would only have made matters worse.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then you know or guess something about this rider?’ said Pippin, who had caught the muttered words.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know, and I would rather not guess,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘All right, cousin Frodo! You can keep your secret for the present, if you want to be mysterious. In the meanwhile what are&#13;
         we to do? I should like a bite and a sup, but somehow I think we had better move on from here. Your talk of sniffing riders&#13;
         with invisible noses has unsettled me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, I think we will move on now,’ said Frodo; ‘but not on the road – in case that rider comes back, or another follows him.&#13;
         We ought to do a good step more today. Buckland is still miles away.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass, as they started off again. They now kept a stone’s throw to the&#13;
         left of the road, and kept out of sight of it as much as they could. But this hindered them; for the grass was thick and tussocky,&#13;
         and the ground uneven, and the trees began to draw together into thickets.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The sun had gone down red behind the hills at their backs, and evening was coming on before they came back to the road at&#13;
         the end of the long level over which it had run straight for some miles. At that point it bent left and went down into the&#13;
         lowlands of the Yale making for Stock; but a lane branched right, winding through a wood of ancient oak-trees on its way to&#13;
         Woodhall. ‘That is the way for us,’ said Frodo.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree: it was still alive and had leaves on the small branches&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page101"/>that it had put out round the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it was hollow, and could be entered by a great crack&#13;
         on the side away from the road. The hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a floor of old leaves and decayed wood. They&#13;
         rested and had a light meal, talking quietly and listening from time to time.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane. The West wind was sighing in the branches. Leaves were whispering.&#13;
         Soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk. A star came out above the trees in the darkening East before&#13;
         them. They went abreast and in step, to keep up their spirits. After a time, as the stars grew thicker and brighter, the feeling&#13;
         of disquiet left them, and they no longer listened for the sound of hoofs. They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way&#13;
         of doing as they walk along, especially when they are drawing near to home at night. With most hobbits it is a supper-song&#13;
         or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). Bilbo&#13;
         Baggins had made the words, to a tune that was as old as the hills, and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of&#13;
         the Water-valley and talked about Adventure.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Upon the hearth the fire is red,</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext3"><em>And then to bed! And then to bed!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>The song ended. ‘And <em>now</em> to bed! And <em>now</em> to bed!’ sang Pippin in a high voice.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hush!’ said Frodo. ‘I think I hear hoofs again.’</p>&#13;
      <p>They stopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree-shadows, listening. There was a sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind,&#13;
         but coming slow and clear down the wind. Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and ran into the deeper shade under&#13;
         the oak-trees.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Don’t let us go too far!’ said Frodo. ‘I don’t want to be seen, but I want to see if it is another Black Rider.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very well!’ said Pippin. ‘But don’t forget the sniffing!’</p>&#13;
      <p>The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better than the general darkness under the trees; Sam and&#13;
         Pippin crouched behind a large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane. It showed grey and pale, a&#13;
         line of fading light through the wood. Above it the stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The sound of hoofs stopped. As Frodo watched he saw &#13;
         <a id="page103"/>something dark pass across the lighter space between two trees, and then halt. It looked like the black shade of a horse led&#13;
         by a smaller black shadow. The black shadow stood close to the point where they had left the path, and it swayed from side&#13;
         to side. Frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling. The shadow bent to the ground, and then began to crawl towards him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Once more the desire to slip on the Ring came over Frodo; but this time it was stronger than before. So strong that, almost&#13;
         before he realized what he was doing, his hand was groping in his pocket. But at that moment there came a sound like mingled&#13;
         song and laughter. Clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air. The black shadow straightened up and retreated. It climbed&#13;
         on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side. Frodo breathed again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Elves!’ exclaimed Sam in a hoarse whisper. ‘Elves, sir!’ He would have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the&#13;
         voices, if they had not pulled him back.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, it is Elves,’ said Frodo. ‘One can meet them sometimes in the Woody End. They don’t live in the Shire, but they wander&#13;
         into it in spring and autumn, out of their own lands away beyond the Tower Hills. I am thankful that they do! You did not&#13;
         see, but that Black Rider stopped just here and was actually crawling towards us when the song began. As soon as he heard&#13;
         the voices he slipped away.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What about the Elves?’ said Sam, too excited to trouble about the rider. ‘Can’t we go and see them?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Listen! They are coming this way,’ said Frodo. ‘We have only to wait.’</p>&#13;
      <p>The singing drew nearer. One clear voice rose now above the others. It was singing in the fair elven-tongue, of which Frodo&#13;
         knew only a little, and the others knew nothing. Yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape itself in their thought&#13;
         into words which they only partly understood. This was the song as Frodo heard it:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page104"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>O Queen beyond the Western Seas</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>O Light to us that wander here</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Amid the world of woven trees!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Gilthoniel! O Elbereth!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Snow-white! Snow-white! We sing to thee</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>In a far land beyond the Sea.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>O stars that in the Sunless Year</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>With shining hand by her were sown,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>In windy fields now bright and clear</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>We see your silver blossom blown!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>We still remember, we who dwell</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>In this far land beneath the trees,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>Thy starlight on the Western Seas.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>The song ended. ‘These are High Elves! They spoke the name of Elbereth!’ said Frodo in amazement. ‘Few of that fairest folk&#13;
         are ever seen in the Shire. Not many now remain in Middle-earth, east of the Great Sea. This is indeed a strange chance!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside. Before long the Elves came down the lane towards the valley. They passed slowly,&#13;
         and the hobbits could see the starlight glimmering on their hair and in their eyes. They bore no lights, yet as they walked&#13;
         a shimmer, like the light of the moon above the rim of the hills before it rises, seemed to fall about their feet. They were&#13;
         now silent, and as the last Elf passed he turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hail, Frodo!’ he cried. ‘You are abroad late. Or are you perhaps lost?’ Then he called aloud to the others, and all the company&#13;
         stopped and gathered round.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘This is indeed wonderful!’ they said. ‘Three hobbits in a &#13;
         <a id="page105"/>wood at night! We have not seen such a thing since Bilbo went away. What is the meaning of it?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The meaning of it, fair people,’ said Frodo, ‘is simply that we seem to be going the same way as you are. I like walking&#13;
         under the stars. But I would welcome your company.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are so dull,’ they laughed. ‘And how do you know that we go the same way&#13;
         as you, for you do not know whither we are going?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And how do you know my name?’ asked Frodo in return.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We know many things,’ they said. ‘We have seen you often before with Bilbo, though you may not have seen us.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who are you, and who is your lord?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am Gildor,’ answered their leader, the Elf who had first hailed him. ‘Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod. We are Exiles,&#13;
         and most of our kindred have long ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here a while, ere we return over the Great&#13;
         Sea. But some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peace in Rivendell. Come now, Frodo, tell us what you are doing? For we see that&#13;
         there is some shadow of fear upon you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘O Wise People!’ interrupted Pippin eagerly. ‘Tell us about the Black Riders!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Black Riders?’ they said in low voices. ‘Why do you ask about Black Riders?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Because two Black Riders have overtaken us today, or one has done so twice,’ said Pippin; ‘only a little while ago he slipped&#13;
         away as you drew near.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Elves did not answer at once, but spoke together softly in their own tongue. At length Gildor turned to the hobbits. ‘We&#13;
         will not speak of this here,’ he said. ‘We think you had best come now with us. It is not our custom, but for this time we&#13;
         will take you on our road, and you shall lodge with us tonight, if you will.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘O Fair Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,’ said Pippin. Sam was speechless. ‘I thank you indeed, Gildor Inglorion,’&#13;
         said Frodo bowing. ‘<em>Elen síla lúmenn’ omentielvo</em>, a star shines on the hour of our meeting,’ he added in the High-elven speech.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page106"/>‘Be careful, friends!’ cried Gildor laughing. ‘Speak no secrets! Here is a scholar in the Ancient Tongue. Bilbo was a good&#13;
         master. Hail, Elf-friend!’ he said, bowing to Frodo. ‘Come now with your friends and join our company! You had best walk in&#13;
         the middle so that you may not stray. You may be weary before we halt.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Why? Where are you going?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘For tonight we go to the woods on the hills above Woodhall. It is some miles, but you shall have rest at the end of it,&#13;
         and it will shorten your journey tomorrow.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They now marched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint lights: for Elves (even more than hobbits) could walk&#13;
         when they wished without sound or footfall. Pippin soon began to feel sleepy, and staggered once or twice; but each time a&#13;
         tall Elf at his side put out his arm and saved him from a fall. Sam walked along at Frodo’s side, as if in a dream, with an&#13;
         expression on his face half of fear and half of astonished joy.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and thicker; and as the lane went lower, running down into&#13;
         a fold of the hills, there were many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand. At last the Elves turned aside&#13;
         from the path. A green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right; and this they followed as it wound away back&#13;
         up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the river-valley. Suddenly&#13;
         they came out of the shadow of the trees, and before them lay a wide space of grass, grey under the night. On three sides&#13;
         the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of the&#13;
         slope, were below their feet. Beyond, the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars. Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled&#13;
         in the village of Woodhall.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; they seemed to take no further notice of the hobbits. Frodo&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page107"/>and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets, and drowsiness stole over them. The night grew on, and the lights&#13;
         in the valley went out. Pippin fell asleep, pillowed on a green hillock.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Away high in the East swung Remmirath, the Netted Stars, and slowly above the mists red Borgil rose, glowing like a jewel&#13;
         of fire. Then by some shift of airs all the mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned up, as he climbed over the rim&#13;
         of the world, the Swordsman of the Sky, Menelvagor with his shining belt. The Elves all burst into song. Suddenly under the&#13;
         trees a fire sprang up with a red light.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come!’ the Elves called to the hobbits. ‘Come! Now is the time for speech and merriment!’</p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. ‘There is a fire in the hall, and food for hungry guests,’ said an Elf standing&#13;
         before him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At the south end of the greensward there was an opening. There the green floor ran on into the wood, and formed a wide space&#13;
         like a hall, roofed by the boughs of trees. Their great trunks ran like pillars down each side. In the middle there was a&#13;
         wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily. The Elves sat round&#13;
         the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn rings of old trunks. Some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink; others&#13;
         brought food on heaped plates and dishes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘This is poor fare,’ they said to the hobbits; ‘for we are lodging in the greenwood far from our halls. If ever you are our&#13;
         guests at home, we will treat you better.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink, for his mind was filled with the light upon the elf-faces, and&#13;
         the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. But he remembered that there was bread, surpassing&#13;
         the savour of a fair white loaf to one who is starving; and fruits sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended &#13;
         <a id="page108"/>fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as a summer&#13;
         afternoon.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam could never describe in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what he felt or thought that night, though it remained&#13;
         in his memory as one of the chief events of his life. The nearest he ever got was to say: ‘Well, sir, if I could grow apples&#13;
         like that, I would call myself a gardener. But it was the singing that went to my heart, if you know what I mean.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was chiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the&#13;
         elf-speech and listened eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own language. They&#13;
         smiled at him and said laughing: ‘Here is a jewel among hobbits!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon&#13;
         a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away. Sam refused to leave his master. When Pippin had gone, he came and sat curled&#13;
         up at Frodo’s feet, where at last he nodded and closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They spoke of many things, old and new, and Frodo questioned Gildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire.&#13;
         The tidings were mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, the wars of Men, and the flight of the Elves. At last Frodo&#13;
         asked the question that was nearest to his heart:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Tell me, Gildor, have you ever seen Bilbo since he left us?’</p>&#13;
      <p>Gildor smiled. ‘Yes,’ he answered. ‘Twice. He said farewell to us on this very spot. But I saw him once again, far from here.’&#13;
         He would say no more about Bilbo, and Frodo fell silent.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, Frodo,’ said Gildor. ‘But I already know a little, and I can read&#13;
         more in your face and in the thought behind your questions. &#13;
         <a id="page109"/>You are leaving the Shire, and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or that you&#13;
         will ever return. Is not that so?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is,’ said Frodo; ‘but I thought my going was a secret known only to Gandalf and my faithful Sam.’ He looked down at Sam,&#13;
         who was snoring gently.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The secret will not reach the Enemy from us,’ said Gildor.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Enemy?’ said Frodo. ‘Then you know why I am leaving the Shire?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you,’ answered Gildor; ‘but I perceive that he is – strange indeed though&#13;
         that seems to me. And I warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you, and upon either side.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You mean the Riders? I feared that they were servants of the Enemy. What <em>are</em> the Black Riders?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Has Gandalf told you nothing?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Nothing about such creatures.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then I think it is not for me to say more – lest terror should keep you from your journey. For it seems to me that you have&#13;
         set out only just in time, if indeed you are in time. You must now make haste, and neither stay nor turn back; for the Shire&#13;
         is no longer any protection to you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I cannot imagine what information could be more terrifying than your hints and warnings,’ exclaimed Frodo. ‘I knew that danger&#13;
         lay ahead, of course; but I did not expect to meet it in our own Shire. Can’t a hobbit walk from the Water to the River in&#13;
         peace?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But it is not your own Shire,’ said Gildor. ‘Others dwelt here before hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when&#13;
         hobbits are no more. The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for ever fence it out.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I know – and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. What can I do now? My plan was to leave the Shire secretly, and&#13;
         make my way to Rivendell; but now my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get to Buckland.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page110"/>‘I think you should still follow that plan,’ said Gildor. ‘I do not think the Road will prove too hard for your courage. But&#13;
         if you desire clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. I do not know the reason for your flight, and therefore I do not know&#13;
         by what means your pursuers will assail you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose that you will see him before you leave&#13;
         the Shire?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. I have been expecting Gandalf for many days. He was to have come&#13;
         to Hobbiton at the latest two nights ago; but he has never appeared. Now I am wondering what can have happened. Should I wait&#13;
         for him?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gildor was silent for a moment. ‘I do not like this news,’ he said at last. ‘That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well.&#13;
         But it is said: <em>Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger.</em> The choice is yours: to go or wait.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And it is also said,’ answered Frodo: ‘<em>Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.</em>’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Is it indeed?’ laughed Gildor. ‘Elves seldom give unguarded advice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to&#13;
         the wise, and all courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning yourself; and how then shall&#13;
         I choose better than you? But if you demand advice, I will for friendship’s sake give it. I think you should now go at once,&#13;
         without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone. Take such friends&#13;
         as are trusty and willing. Now you should be grateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly. The Elves have their own labours&#13;
         and their own sorrows, and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth. Our paths&#13;
         cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. In this meeting there may be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to&#13;
         me, and I fear to say too much.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am deeply grateful,’ said Frodo; ‘but I wish you would tell me plainly what the Black Riders are. If I take your advice&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page111"/>I may not see Gandalf for a long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy?’ answered Gildor. ‘Flee them! Speak no words to them! They&#13;
         are deadly. Ask no more of me! But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, Frodo son of Drogo, will know more of these&#13;
         fell things than Gildor Inglorion. May Elbereth protect you!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But where shall I find courage?’ asked Frodo. ‘That is what I chiefly need.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Courage is found in unlikely places,’ said Gildor. ‘Be of good hope! Sleep now! In the morning we shall have gone; but we&#13;
         will send our messages through the lands. The Wandering Companies shall know of your journey, and those that have power for&#13;
         good shall be on the watch. I name you Elf-friend; and may the stars shine upon the end of your road! Seldom have we had such&#13;
         delight in strangers, and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient Speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo felt sleep coming upon him, even as Gildor finished speaking. ‘I will sleep now,’ he said; and the Elf led him to a&#13;
         bower beside Pippin, and he threw himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber.&#13;

      <p class="cotx">In the morning Frodo woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made by a living tree with branches laced and drooping to the&#13;
         ground; his bed was of fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant. The sun was shining through the fluttering leaves,&#13;
         which were still green upon the tree. He jumped up and went out.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. Pippin was standing studying the sky and weather. There was no sign&#13;
         of the Elves.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘They have left us fruit and drink, and bread,’ said Pippin. ‘Come and have your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good&#13;
         as it did last night. I did not want to leave you any, but Sam insisted.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo sat down beside Sam and began to eat. ‘What is the plan for today?’ asked Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘To walk to Bucklebury as quickly as possible,’ answered Frodo, and gave his attention to the food.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do you think we shall see anything of those Riders?’ asked Pippin cheerfully. Under the morning sun the prospect of seeing&#13;
         a whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, probably,’ said Frodo, not liking the reminder. ‘But I hope to get across the river without their seeing us.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Did you find out anything about them from Gildor?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not much – only hints and riddles,’ said Frodo evasively.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Did you ask about the sniffing?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We didn’t discuss it,’ said Frodo with his mouth full.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You should have. I am sure it is very important.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘In that case I am sure Gildor would have refused to explain it,’ said Frodo sharply. ‘And now leave me in peace for a bit!&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page113"/>I don’t want to answer a string of questions while I am eating. I want to think!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good heavens!’ said Pippin. ‘At breakfast?’ He walked away towards the edge of the green.</p>&#13;
      <p>From Frodo’s mind the bright morning – treacherously bright, he thought – had not banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered&#13;
         the words of Gildor. The merry voice of Pippin came to him. He was running on the green turf and singing.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No! I could not!’ he said to himself. ‘It is one thing to take my young friends walking over the Shire with me, until we&#13;
         are hungry and weary, and food and bed are sweet. To take them into exile, where hunger and weariness may have no cure, is&#13;
         quite another – even if they are willing to come. The inheritance is mine alone. I don’t think I ought even to take Sam.’&#13;
         He looked at Sam Gamgee, and discovered that Sam was watching him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, Sam!’ he said. ‘What about it? I am leaving the Shire as soon as ever I can – in fact I have made up my mind now not&#13;
         even to wait a day at Crickhollow, if it can be helped.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very good, sir!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You still mean to come with me?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is going to be very dangerous, Sam. It is already dangerous. Most likely neither of us will come back.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘If you don’t come back, sir, then I shan’t, that’s certain,’ said Sam. ‘<em>Don’t you leave him!</em> they said to me. <em>Leave him!</em> I said. <em>I never mean to. I am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon; and if any of those Black Riders try to stop him, they’ll&#13;
            have Sam Gamgee to reckon with</em>, I said. They laughed.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who are <em>they</em>, and what are you talking about?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Elves, sir. We had some talk last night; and they seemed to know you were going away, so I didn’t see the use of denying&#13;
         it. Wonderful folk, Elves, sir! Wonderful!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘They are,’ said Frodo. ‘Do you like them still, now you have had a closer view?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,’ answered Sam slowly. ‘It don’t seem to matter what I think &#13;
         <a id="page114"/>about them. They are quite different from what I expected – so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it were.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo looked at Sam rather startled, half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come over&#13;
         him. It did not sound like the voice of the old Sam Gamgee that he thought he knew. But it looked like the old Sam Gamgee&#13;
         sitting there, except that his face was unusually thoughtful.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do you feel any need to leave the Shire now – now that your wish to see them has come true already?’ he asked.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, sir. I don’t know how to say it, but after last night I feel different. I seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know&#13;
         we are going to take a very long road, into darkness; but I know I can’t turn back. It isn’t to see Elves now, nor dragons,&#13;
         nor mountains, that I want – I don’t rightly know what I want: but I have something to do before the end, and it lies ahead,&#13;
         not in the Shire. I must see it through, sir, if you understand me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t altogether. But I understand that Gandalf chose me a good companion. I am content. We will go together.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked over the land ahead, and called to Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘All ready to start?’ he said as Pippin ran up. ‘We must be getting off at once. We slept late; and there are a good many&#13;
         miles to go.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>You</em> slept late, you mean,’ said Pippin. ‘I was up long before; and we are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have finished both now. And I am going to make for Bucklebury Ferry as quickly as possible. I am not going out of the way,&#13;
         back to the road we left last night: I am going to cut straight across country from here.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then you are going to fly,’ said Pippin. ‘You won’t cut straight on foot anywhere in this country.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We can cut straighter than the road anyway,’ answered Frodo. ‘The Ferry is east from Woodhall; but the hard road curves away&#13;
         to the left – you can see a bend of it away north &#13;
         <a id="page115"/>over there. It goes round the north end of the Marish so as to strike the causeway from the Bridge above Stock. But that is&#13;
         miles out of the way. We could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the Ferry from where we stand.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>Short cuts make long delays</em>,’ argued Pippin. ‘The country is rough round here, and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the Marish –&#13;
         I know the land in these parts. And if you are worrying about Black Riders, I can’t see that it is any worse meeting them&#13;
         on a road than in a wood or a field.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,’ answered Frodo. ‘And if you are supposed to be on the road, there&#13;
         is some chance that you will be looked for on the road and not off it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All right!’ said Pippin. ‘I will follow you into every bog and ditch. But it is hard! I had counted on passing the <em>Golden Perch</em> at Stock before sundown. The best beer in the Eastfarthing, or used to be: it is a long time since I tasted it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That settles it!’ said Frodo. ‘Short cuts make delays, but inns make longer ones. At all costs we must keep you away from&#13;
         the <em>Golden Perch</em>. We want to get to Bucklebury before dark. What do you say, Sam?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will go along with you, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam (in spite of private misgivings and a deep regret for the best beer in the&#13;
         Eastfarthing).&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let’s go now!’ said Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">It was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before; but clouds were beginning to come up from the West. It looked&#13;
         likely to turn to rain. The hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees below. Their course&#13;
         had been chosen to leave Woodhall to their left, and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered along the eastern side&#13;
         of the hills, until they reached the flats beyond. Then they could make straight for the Ferry over country that was open,&#13;
         except for a few ditches and fences. &#13;
         <a id="page116"/>Frodo reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had appeared. There were no paths in the undergrowth,&#13;
         and they did not get on very fast. When they had struggled to the bottom of the bank, they found a stream running down from&#13;
         the hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles. Most inconveniently it cut across the&#13;
         line they had chosen. They could not jump over it, nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet, scratched, and muddy.&#13;
         They halted, wondering what to do. ‘First check!’ said Pippin, smiling grimly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam Gamgee looked back. Through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had&#13;
         climbed down.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Look!’ he said, clutching Frodo by the arm. They all looked, and on the edge high above them they saw against the sky a horse&#13;
         standing. Beside it stooped a black figure.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They at once gave up any idea of going back. Frodo led the way, and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream.&#13;
         ‘Whew!’ he said to Pippin. ‘We were both right! The short cut has gone crooked already; but we got under cover only just in&#13;
         time. You’ve got sharp ears, Sam: can you hear anything coming?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They stood still, almost holding their breath as they listened; but there was no sound of pursuit. ‘I don’t fancy he would&#13;
         try bringing his horse down that bank,’ said Sam. ‘But I guess he knows we came down it. We had better be going on.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Going on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, and the bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through.&#13;
         They were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind, and the air was still and stuffy. When they forced their way at last&#13;
         into more open ground, they were hot and tired and very scratched, and they were also no longer certain of the direction in&#13;
         which they were going. The banks of the stream sank, as it reached the levels and became broader and shallower, wandering&#13;
         off towards the Marish and the River.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page117"/>‘Why, this is the Stock-brook!’ said Pippin. ‘If we are going to try and get back on to our course, we must cross at once&#13;
         and bear right.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They waded the stream, and hurried over a wide open space, rush-grown and treeless, on the further side. Beyond that they&#13;
         came again to a belt of trees: tall oaks, for the most part, with here and there an elm tree or an ash. The ground was fairly&#13;
         level, and there was little undergrowth; but the trees were too close for them to see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards in&#13;
         sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky. Then the wind died away and the rain came streaming&#13;
         down. They trudged along as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and through thick drifts of old leaves; and all about&#13;
         them the rain pattered and trickled. They did not talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After half an hour Pippin said: ‘I hope we have not turned too much towards the south, and are not walking longwise through&#13;
         this wood! It is not a very broad belt – I should have said no more than a mile at the widest – and we ought to have been&#13;
         through it by now.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,’ said Frodo. ‘That won’t mend matters. Let us keep on as we are going! I am&#13;
         not sure that I want to come out into the open yet.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They went on for perhaps another couple of miles. Then the sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened. It&#13;
         was now past mid-day, and they felt it was high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its leaves though fast turning&#13;
         yellow were still thick, and the ground at its feet was fairly dry and sheltered. When they came to make their meal, they&#13;
         found that the Elves had filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale golden in colour: it had the scent of a honey made&#13;
         of many flowers, and was wonderfully refreshing. Very soon they were laughing, and snapping their fingers at rain, and at&#13;
         Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt, would soon be behind them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page118"/>Frodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. Sam and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum, and then&#13;
         to sing softly:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Ho! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>To heal my heart and drown my woe.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Rain may fall and wind may blow,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And many miles be still to go,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>But under a tall tree I will lie,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>And let the clouds go sailing by.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="p1"><em>Ho! Ho! Ho!</em> they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. Frodo sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came down the wind, like&#13;
         the cry of some evil and lonely creature. It rose and fell, and ended on a high piercing note. Even as they sat and stood,&#13;
         as if suddenly frozen, it was answered by another cry, fainter and further off, but no less chilling to the blood. There was&#13;
         then a silence, broken only by the sound of the wind in the leaves.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And what do you think that was?’ Pippin asked at last, trying to speak lightly, but quavering a little. ‘If it was a bird,&#13;
         it was one that I never heard in the Shire before.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was not bird or beast,’ said Frodo. ‘It was a call, or a signal – there were words in that cry, though I could not catch&#13;
         them. But no hobbit has such a voice.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>No more was said about it. They were all thinking of the Riders, but no one spoke of them. They were now reluctant either&#13;
         to stay or go on; but sooner or later they had got to get across the open country to the Ferry, and it was best to go sooner&#13;
         and in daylight. In a few moments they had shouldered their packs again and were off.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Before long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grasslands stretched before them. They now saw that they had, in fact, turned&#13;
         too much to the south. Away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill of Bucklebury across the River, but it was now&#13;
         to their left. Creeping cautiously out from the &#13;
         <a id="page119"/>edge of the trees, they set off across the open as quickly as they could.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At first they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. Far back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted.&#13;
         Frodo half expected to see the small distant figure of a horseman on the ridge dark against the sky; but there was no sign&#13;
         of one. The sun escaping from the breaking clouds, as it sank towards the hills they had left, was now shining brightly again.&#13;
         Their fear left them, though they still felt uneasy. But the land became steadily more tame and well-ordered. Soon they came&#13;
         into well-tended fields and meadows: there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful,&#13;
         just an ordinary corner of the Shire. Their spirits rose with every step. The line of the River grew nearer; and the Black&#13;
         Riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now left far behind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout gate. Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid&#13;
         hedges towards a distant clump of trees. Pippin stopped.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I know these fields and this gate!’ he said. ‘This is Bamfurlong, old Farmer Maggot’s land. That’s his farm away there in&#13;
         the trees.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘One trouble after another!’ said Frodo, looking nearly as much alarmed as if Pippin had declared the lane was the slot leading&#13;
         to a dragon’s den. The others looked at him in surprise.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What’s wrong with old Maggot?’ asked Pippin. ‘He’s a good friend to all the Brandybucks. Of course he’s a terror to trespassers,&#13;
         and keeps ferocious dogs – but after all, folk down here are near the border and have to be more on their guard.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I know,’ said Frodo. ‘But all the same,’ he added with a shamefaced laugh, ‘I am terrified of him and his dogs. I have avoided&#13;
         his farm for years and years. He caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms, when I was a youngster at Brandy Hall.&#13;
         On the last occasion he beat me, and then &#13;
         <a id="page120"/>took me and showed me to his dogs. “See, lads,” he said, “next time this young varmint sets foot on my land, you can eat him.&#13;
         Now see him off!” They chased me all the way to the Ferry. I have never got over the fright – though I daresay the beasts&#13;
         knew their business and would not really have touched me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin laughed. ‘Well, it’s time you made it up. Especially if you are coming back to live in Buckland. Old Maggot is really&#13;
         a stout fellow – if you leave his mushrooms alone. Let’s get into the lane and then we shan’t be trespassing. If we meet him,&#13;
         I’ll do the talking. He is a friend of Merry’s, and I used to come here with him a good deal at one time.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of a large house and farm-buildings peeping out among the trees&#13;
         ahead. The Maggots, and the Puddifoots of Stock, and most of the inhabitants of the Marish, were house-dwellers; and this&#13;
         farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it. There was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into&#13;
         the lane.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out, and a loud voice was heard shouting: ‘Grip! Fang! Wolf! Come on, lads!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo and Sam stopped dead, but Pippin walked on a few paces. The gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out into the&#13;
         lane, and dashed towards the travellers, barking fiercely. They took no notice of Pippin; but Sam shrank against the wall,&#13;
         while two wolvish-looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously, and snarled if he moved. The largest and most ferocious of the&#13;
         three halted in front of Frodo, bristling and growling.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Through the gate there now appeared a broad thick-set hobbit with a round red face. ‘Hallo! Hallo! And who may you be, and&#13;
         what may you be wanting?’ he asked.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good afternoon, Mr. Maggot!’ said Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p>The farmer looked at him closely. ‘Well, if it isn’t Master Pippin – Mr. Peregrin Took, I should say!’ he cried, changing&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page121"/>from a scowl to a grin. ‘It’s a long time since I saw you round here. It’s lucky for you that I know you. I was just going&#13;
         out to set my dogs on any strangers. There are some funny things going on today. Of course, we do get queer folk wandering&#13;
         in these parts at times. Too near the River,’ he said, shaking his head. ‘But this fellow was the most outlandish I have ever&#13;
         set eyes on. He won’t cross my land without leave a second time, not if I can stop it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What fellow do you mean?’ asked Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then you haven’t seen him?’ said the farmer. ‘He went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back. He was a funny&#13;
         customer and asking funny questions. But perhaps you’ll come along inside, and we’ll pass the news more comfortable. I’ve&#13;
         a drop of good ale on tap, if you and your friends are willing, Mr. Took.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do it in his own time and fashion, so they all accepted&#13;
         the invitation. ‘What about the dogs?’ asked Frodo anxiously.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The farmer laughed. ‘They won’t harm you – not unless I tell ’em to. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!’ he cried. ‘Heel, Wolf!’ To&#13;
         the relief of Frodo and Sam, the dogs walked away and let them go free.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin introduced the other two to the farmer. ‘Mr. Frodo Baggins,’ he said. ‘You may not remember him, but he used to live&#13;
         at Brandy Hall.’ At the name Baggins the farmer started, and gave Frodo a sharp glance. For a moment Frodo thought that the&#13;
         memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and that the dogs would be told to see him off. But Farmer Maggot took him by&#13;
         the arm.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, if that isn’t queerer than ever!’ he exclaimed. ‘Mr. Baggins is it? Come inside! We must have a talk.’</p>&#13;
      <p>They went into the farmer’s kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place. Mrs. Maggot brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled&#13;
         four large mugs. It was a good brew, and Pippin found himself more than compensated for missing the <em>Golden Perch</em>. Sam sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a natural mistrust &#13;
         <a id="page122"/>of the inhabitants of other parts of the Shire; and also he was not disposed to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten&#13;
         his master, however long ago.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After a few remarks about the weather and the agricultural prospects (which were no worse than usual), Farmer Maggot put down&#13;
         his mug and looked at them all in turn.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now, Mr. Peregrin,’ he said, ‘where might you be coming from, and where might you be going to? Were you coming to visit me?&#13;
         For, if so, you had gone past my gate without my seeing you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, no,’ answered Pippin. ‘To tell you the truth, since you have guessed it, we got into the lane from the other end: we&#13;
         had come over your fields. But that was quite by accident. We lost our way in the woods, back near Woodhall, trying to take&#13;
         a short cut to the Ferry.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,’ said the farmer. ‘But I wasn’t worrying about that. You have&#13;
         leave to walk over my land, if you have a mind, Mr. Peregrin. And you, Mr. Baggins – though I daresay you still like mushrooms.’&#13;
         He laughed. ‘Ah yes, I recognized the name. I recollect the time when young Frodo Baggins was one of the worst young rascals&#13;
         of Buckland. But it wasn’t mushrooms I was thinking of. I had just heard the name Baggins before you turned up. What do you&#13;
         think that funny customer asked me?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They waited anxiously for him to go on. ‘Well,’ the farmer continued, approaching his point with slow relish, ‘he came riding&#13;
         on a big black horse in at the gate, which happened to be open, and right up to my door. All black he was himself, too, and&#13;
         cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not want to be known. “Now what in the Shire can he want?” I thought to myself. We don’t&#13;
         see many of the Big Folk over the border; and anyway I had never heard of any like this black fellow.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Good-day to you!” I says, going out to him. “This lane don’t lead anywhere, and wherever you may be going, your quickest&#13;
         way will be back to the road.” I didn’t like the looks of him; and when Grip came out, he took one sniff and let &#13;
         <a id="page123"/>out a yelp as if he had been stung: he put down his tail and bolted off howling. The black fellow sat quite still.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “I come from yonder,” he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back west, over <em>my</em> fields, if you please. “Have you seen <em>Baggins</em>?” he asked in a queer voice, and bent down towards me. I could not see any face, for his hood fell down so low; and I felt&#13;
         a sort of shiver down my back. But I did not see why he should come riding over my land so bold.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Be off!” I said. “There are no Bagginses here. You’re in the wrong part of the Shire. You had better go back west to Hobbiton&#13;
         – but you can go by road this time.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Baggins has left,” he answered in a whisper. “He is coming. He is not far away. I wish to find him. If he passes will you&#13;
         tell me? I will come back with gold.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “No you won’t,” I said. “You’ll go back where you belong, double quick. I give you one minute before I call all my dogs.”</p>&#13;
      <p>‘He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not. Then he spurred his great horse right at me, and I&#13;
         jumped out of the way only just in time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the gate and up the lane towards&#13;
         the causeway like a bolt of thunder. What do you think of that?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thought was how on earth would they reach the Ferry. ‘I don’t know&#13;
         what to think,’ he said at last.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then I’ll tell you what to think,’ said Maggot. ‘You should never have gone mixing yourself up with Hobbiton folk, Mr. Frodo.&#13;
         Folk are queer up there.’ Sam stirred in his chair, and looked at the farmer with an unfriendly eye. ‘But you were always&#13;
         a reckless lad. When I heard you had left the Brandybucks and gone off to that old Mr. Bilbo, I said that you were going&#13;
         to find trouble. Mark my words, this all comes of those strange doings of Mr. Bilbo’s. His money was got in some strange fashion&#13;
         in foreign parts, they say. Maybe there is some that want to know what has become of the gold and jewels that he buried in&#13;
         the hill of Hobbiton, as I hear?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page124"/>Frodo said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, Mr. Frodo,’ Maggot went on, ‘I’m glad that you’ve had the sense to come back to Buckland. My advice is: stay there!&#13;
         And don’t get mixed up with these outlandish folk. You’ll have friends in these parts. If any of these black fellows come&#13;
         after you again, I’ll deal with them. I’ll say you’re dead, or have left the Shire, or anything you like. And that might be&#13;
         true enough; for as like as not it is old Mr. Bilbo they want news of.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Maybe you’re right,’ said Frodo, avoiding the farmer’s eye and staring at the fire.</p>&#13;
      <p>Maggot looked at him thoughtfully. ‘Well, I see you have ideas of your own,’ he said. ‘It is as plain as my nose that no accident&#13;
         brought you and that rider here on the same afternoon; and maybe my news was no great news to you, after all. I am not asking&#13;
         you to tell me anything you have a mind to keep to yourself; but I see you are in some kind of trouble. Perhaps you are thinking&#13;
         it won’t be too easy to get to the Ferry without being caught?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I was thinking so,’ said Frodo. ‘But we have got to try and get there; and it won’t be done by sitting and thinking. So I&#13;
         am afraid we must be going. Thank you very much indeed for your kindness! I’ve been in terror of you and your dogs for over&#13;
         thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh to hear it. It’s a pity: for I’ve missed a good friend. And now I’m sorry&#13;
         to leave so soon. But I’ll come back, perhaps, one day – if I get a chance.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You’ll be welcome when you come,’ said Maggot. ‘But now I’ve a notion. It’s near sundown already, and we are going to have&#13;
         our supper; for we mostly go to bed soon after the Sun. If you and Mr. Peregrin and all could stay and have a bite with us,&#13;
         we would be pleased!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And so should we!’ said Frodo. ‘But we must be going at once, I’m afraid. Even now it will be dark before we can reach the&#13;
         Ferry.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah! but wait a minute! I was going to say: after a bit of &#13;
         <a id="page125"/>supper, I’ll get out a small waggon, and I’ll drive you all to the Ferry. That will save you a good step, and it might also&#13;
         save you trouble of another sort.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of Pippin and Sam. The sun was already behind the western hills,&#13;
         and the light was failing. Two of Maggot’s sons and his three daughters came in, and a generous supper was laid on the large&#13;
         table. The kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended. Mrs. Maggot bustled in and out. One or two other hobbits&#13;
         belonging to the farm-household came in. In a short while fourteen sat down to eat. There was beer in plenty, and a mighty&#13;
         dish of mushrooms and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rinds and cracked&#13;
         bones.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern and got the waggon ready. It was dark in the yard,&#13;
         when the guests came out. They threw their packs on board and climbed in. The farmer sat in the driving-seat, and whipped&#13;
         up his two stout ponies. His wife stood in the light of the open door.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You be careful of yourself, Maggot!’ she called. ‘Don’t go arguing with any foreigners, and come straight back!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will!’ said he, and drove out of the gate. There was now no breath of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and&#13;
         a chill was in the air. They went without lights and took it slowly. After a mile or two the lane came to an end, crossing&#13;
         a deep dike, and climbing a short slope up on to the high-banked causeway.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Maggot got down and took a good look either way, north and south, but nothing could be seen in the darkness, and there was&#13;
         not a sound in the still air. Thin strands of river-mist were hanging above the dikes, and crawling over the fields.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It’s going to be thick,’ said Maggot; ‘but I’ll not light my lanterns till I turn for home. We’ll hear anything on the road&#13;
         long before we meet it tonight.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      &#13;
<p class="spb">&#13;
         <a id="page126"/>It was five miles or more from Maggot’s lane to the Ferry. The hobbits wrapped themselves up, but their ears were strained&#13;
         for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow <em>clop</em> of the ponies’ hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a snail to Frodo. Beside him Pippin was nodding towards sleep; but Sam&#13;
         was staring forwards into the rising fog.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They reached the entrance to the Ferry lane at last. It was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly loomed up on their&#13;
         right. Farmer Maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt. They were just beginning to scramble out, when suddenly&#13;
         they heard what they had all been dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The sound was coming towards them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies’ heads, and peering forward into the gloom. <em>Clip-clop</em>, <em>clip-clop</em> came the approaching rider. The fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still, foggy air.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You’d better be hidden, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam anxiously. ‘You get down in the waggon and cover up with blankets, and we’ll&#13;
         send this rider to the rightabouts!’ He climbed out and went to the farmer’s side. Black Riders would have to ride over him&#13;
         to get near the waggon.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>Clop-clop, clop-clop</em>. The rider was nearly on them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>  ‘Hallo there!’ called Farmer Maggot. The advancing hoofs stopped short. They thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked&#13;
         shape in the mist, a yard or two ahead.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now then!’ said the farmer, throwing the reins to Sam and striding forward. ‘Don’t you come a step nearer! What do you want,&#13;
         and where are you going?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I want Mr. Baggins. Have you seen him?’ said a muffled voice – but the voice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck. A dark lantern&#13;
         was uncovered, and its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Mr. Merry!’ he cried.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, of course! Who did you think it was?’ said Merry coming forward. As he came out of the mist and their fears &#13;
         <a id="page127"/>subsided, he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit-size. He was riding a pony, and a scarf was swathed round his&#13;
         neck and over his chin to keep out the fog.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him. ‘So there you are at last!’ said Merry. ‘I was beginning to wonder if you would&#13;
         turn up at all today, and I was just going back to supper. When it grew foggy I came across and rode up towards Stock to see&#13;
         if you had fallen in any ditches. But I’m blest if I know which way you have come. Where did you find them, Mr. Maggot? In&#13;
         your duck-pond?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, I caught ’em trespassing,’ said the farmer, ‘and nearly set my dogs on ’em; but they’ll tell you all the story, I’ve&#13;
         no doubt. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Mr. Merry and Mr. Frodo and all, I’d best be turning for home. Mrs. Maggot will be worriting&#13;
         with the night getting thick.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. ‘Well, good night to you all,’ he said. ‘It’s been a queer day, and no mistake.&#13;
         But all’s well as ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors. I’ll not deny that I’ll be&#13;
         glad now when I do.’ He lit his lanterns, and got up. Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat. ‘I was nearly&#13;
         forgetting,’ he said. ‘Mrs. Maggot put this up for Mr. Baggins, with her compliments.’ He handed it down and moved off, followed&#13;
         by a chorus of thanks and good-nights.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns as they dwindled into the foggy night. Suddenly Frodo laughed: from&#13;
         the covered basket he held, the scent of mushrooms was rising.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

      <p class="cotx">‘Now we had better get home ourselves,’ said Merry. ‘There’s something funny about all this, I see; but it must wait till&#13;
         we get in.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They turned down the Ferry lane, which was straight and well-kept and edged with large white-washed stones. In a hundred yards&#13;
         or so it brought them to the river-bank, where there was a broad wooden landing-stage. A large flat ferry-boat was moored&#13;
         beside it. The white bollards near the water’s edge glimmered in the light of two lamps on high posts. Behind them the mists&#13;
         in the flat fields were now above the hedges; but the water before them was dark, with only a few curling wisps like steam&#13;
         among the reeds by the bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further side.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others followed. Merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole.&#13;
         The Brandywine flowed slow and broad before them. On the other side the bank was steep, and up it a winding path climbed from&#13;
         the further landing. Lamps were twinkling there. Behind loomed up the Buck Hill; and out of it, through stray shrouds of mist,&#13;
         shone many round windows, yellow and red. They were the windows of Brandy Hall, the ancient home of the Brandybucks.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Long ago Gorhendad Oldbuck, head of the Oldbuck family, one of the oldest in the Marish or indeed in the Shire, had crossed&#13;
         the river, which was the original boundary of the land eastwards. He built (and excavated) Brandy Hall, changed his name to&#13;
         Brandybuck, and settled down to become master of what was virtually a small independent country. His family grew and grew,&#13;
         and after his days continued &#13;
         <a id="page129"/>to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the low hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors, and about&#13;
         a hundred windows. The Brandybucks and their numerous dependants then began to burrow, and later to build, all round about.&#13;
         That was the origin of <a href="Fellowshipofth_prol-1.html#prl">Buckland</a>, a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the Old Forest, a sort of colony from the&#13;
         Shire. Its chief village was Bucklebury, clustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The people in the Marish were friendly with the Bucklanders, and the authority of the Master of the Hall (as the head of&#13;
         the Brandybuck family was called) was still acknowledged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey. But most of the folk of&#13;
         the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as peculiar, half foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter of fact, they were not&#13;
         very different from the other hobbits of the Four Farthings. Except in one point: they were fond of boats, and some of them&#13;
         could swim.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Their land was originally unprotected from the East; but on that side they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had been planted&#13;
         many generations ago, and was now thick and tall, for it was constantly tended. It ran all the way from Brandywine Bridge,&#13;
         in a big loop curving away from the river, to Haysend (where the Withywindle flowed out of the Forest into the Brandywine):&#13;
         well over twenty miles from end to end. But, of course, it was not a complete protection. The Forest drew close to the hedge&#13;
         in many places. The Bucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also was not usual in the Shire.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buckland shore drew nearer. Sam was the only member of the party who had&#13;
         not been over the river before. He had a strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind in&#13;
         the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched his head, and for a moment had a passing wish that Mr. Frodo could have&#13;
         gone on living quietly at Bag End.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The four hobbits stepped off the ferry. Merry was tying it &#13;
         <a id="page130"/>up, and Pippin was already leading the pony up the path, when Sam (who had been looking back, as if to take farewell of the&#13;
         Shire) said in a hoarse whisper:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Look back, Mr. Frodo! Do you see anything?’</p>&#13;
      <p>On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left behind.&#13;
         But as they looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that, as if searching the ground. It then crawled, or went crouching,&#13;
         back into the gloom beyond the lamps.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What in the Shire is that?’ exclaimed Merry.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Something that is following us,’ said Frodo. ‘But don’t ask any more now! Let’s get away at once!’ They hurried up the path&#13;
         to the top of the bank, but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist, and nothing could be seen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Thank goodness you don’t keep any boats on the west-bank!’ said Frodo. ‘Can horses cross the river?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘They can go ten miles north to Brandywine Bridge – or they might swim,’ answered Merry. ‘Though I never heard of any horse&#13;
         swimming the Brandywine. But what have horses to do with it?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I’ll tell you later. Let’s get indoors and then we can talk.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘All right! You and Pippin know your way; so I’ll just ride on and tell Fatty Bolger that you are coming. We’ll see about&#13;
         supper and things.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We had our supper early with Farmer Maggot,’ said Frodo; ‘but we could do with another.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You shall have it! Give me that basket!’ said Merry, and rode ahead into the darkness.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">It was some distance from the Brandywine to Frodo’s new house at Crickhollow. They passed Buck Hill and Brandy Hall on their&#13;
         left, and on the outskirts of Bucklebury struck the main road of Buckland that ran south from the Bridge. Half a mile northward&#13;
         along this they came to a lane opening on their right. This they followed for a couple of miles as it climbed up and down&#13;
         into the country.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing &#13;
         <a id="page131"/>could be seen of the house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded by a&#13;
         belt of low trees inside the outer hedge. Frodo had chosen it, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of the country,&#13;
         and there were no other dwellings close by. You could get in and out without being noticed. It had been built a long while&#13;
         before by the Brandybucks, for the use of guests, or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of&#13;
         Brandy Hall for a time. It was an old-fashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it was long and&#13;
         low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round windows, and a large round door.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As they walked up the green path from the gate no light was visible; the windows were dark and shuttered. Frodo knocked on&#13;
         the door, and Fatty Bolger opened it. A friendly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light&#13;
         inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on either side; in front of them a passage ran back down the middle of the house.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, what do you think of it?’ asked Merry coming up the passage. ‘We have done our best in a short time to make it look&#13;
         like home. After all Fatty and I only got here with the last cart-load yesterday.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo looked round. It did look like home. Many of his own favourite things – or Bilbo’s things (they reminded him sharply&#13;
         of him in their new setting) – were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at Bag End. It was a pleasant, comfortable,&#13;
         welcoming place; and he found himself wishing that he was really coming here to settle down in quiet retirement. It seemed&#13;
         unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble; and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that&#13;
         he must leave them so soon, indeed at once. Yet that would have to be done that very night, before they all went to bed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It’s delightful!’ he said with an effort. ‘I hardly feel that I have moved at all.’</p>&#13;
      &#13;
<p class="spb">&#13;
         <a id="page132"/>The travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the floor. Merry led them down the passage and threw open a&#13;
         door at the far end. Firelight came out, and a puff of steam.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘A bath!’ cried Pippin. ‘O blessed Meriadoc!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Which order shall we go in?’ said Frodo. ‘Eldest first, or quickest first? You’ll be last either way, Master Peregrin.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Trust me to arrange things better than that!’ said Merry. ‘We can’t begin life at Crickhollow with a quarrel over baths.&#13;
         In that room there are <em>three</em> tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. There are also towels, mats and soap. Get inside, and be quick!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Merry and Fatty went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, and busied themselves with the final preparations&#13;
         for a late supper. Snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound of splashing and wallowing. The&#13;
         voice of Pippin was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of Bilbo’s favourite bath-songs.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Sing hey! for the bath at close of day</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>that washes the weary mud away!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>A loon is he that will not sing:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>O! Water Hot is a noble thing!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>O! Sweet is the sound of falling rain,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>and the brook that leaps from hill to plain;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>but better than rain or rippling streams</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>is Water Hot that smokes and steams.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>O! Water cold we may pour at need</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>but better is Beer, if drink we lack,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>and Water Hot poured down the back.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>O! Water is fair that leaps on high</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>in a fountain white beneath the sky;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>but never did fountain sound so sweet</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>as splashing Hot Water with my feet!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page133"/>There was a terrific splash, and a shout of <em>Whoa!</em> from Frodo. It appeared that a lot of Pippin’s bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on high.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Merry went to the door: ‘What about supper and beer in the throat?’ he called. Frodo came out drying his hair.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘There’s so much water in the air that I’m coming into the kitchen to finish,’ he said.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Lawks!’ said Merry, looking in. The stone floor was swimming. ‘You ought to mop all that up before you get anything to eat,&#13;
         Peregrin,’ he said. ‘Hurry up, or we shan’t wait for you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. ‘I suppose you three won’t want mushrooms again?’ said Fredegar without&#13;
         much hope.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes we shall!’ cried Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘They’re mine!’ said Frodo. ‘Given to <em>me</em> by Mrs. Maggot, a queen among farmers’ wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I’ll serve them.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest likings of Big People. A fact which partly explains young&#13;
         Frodo’s long expeditions to the renowned fields of the Marish, and the wrath of the injured Maggot. On this occasion there&#13;
         was plenty for all, even according to hobbit standards. There were also many other things to follow, and when they had finished&#13;
         even Fatty Bolger heaved a sigh of content. They pushed back the table, and drew chairs round the fire.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We’ll clear up later,’ said Merry. ‘Now tell me all about it! I guess that you have been having adventures, which was not&#13;
         quite fair without me. I want a full account; and most of all I want to know what was the matter with old Maggot, and why&#13;
         he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was <em>scared</em>, if that is possible.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We have all been scared,’ said Pippin after a pause, in which Frodo stared at the fire and did not speak. ‘You would have&#13;
         been, too, if you had been chased for two days by Black Riders.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page134"/>‘And what are they?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Black figures riding on black horses,’ answered Pippin. ‘If Frodo won’t talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.’&#13;
         He then gave a full account of their journey from the time when they left Hobbiton. Sam gave various supporting nods and exclamations.&#13;
         Frodo remained silent.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I should think you were making it all up,’ said Merry, ‘if I had not seen that black shape on the landing-stage – and heard&#13;
         the queer sound in Maggot’s voice. What do you make of it all, Frodo?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Cousin Frodo has been very close,’ said Pippin. ‘But the time has come for him to open out. So far we have been given nothing&#13;
         more to go on than Farmer Maggot’s guess that it has something to do with old Bilbo’s treasure.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That was only a guess,’ said Frodo hastily. ‘Maggot does not <em>know</em> anything.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Old Maggot is a shrewd fellow,’ said Merry. ‘A lot goes on behind his round face that does not come out in his talk. I’ve&#13;
         heard that he used to go into the Old Forest at one time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good many strange things.&#13;
         But you can at least tell us, Frodo, whether you think his guess good or bad.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I <em>think</em>,’ answered Frodo slowly, ‘that it was a good guess, as far as it goes. There <em>is</em> a connexion with Bilbo’s old adventures, and the Riders are looking, or perhaps one ought to say <em>searching</em>, for him or for me. I also fear, if you want to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not safe here or anywhere&#13;
         else.’ He looked round at the windows and walls, as if he was afraid they would suddenly give way. The others looked at him&#13;
         in silence, and exchanged meaning glances among themselves.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It’s coming out in a minute,’ whispered Pippin to Merry. Merry nodded.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well!’ said Frodo at last, sitting up and straightening his back, as if he had made a decision. ‘I can’t keep it dark any&#13;
         longer. I have got something to tell you all. But I don’t know quite how to begin.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page135"/>‘I think I could help you,’ said Merry quietly, ‘by telling you some of it myself.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you mean?’ said Frodo, looking at him anxiously.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Just this, my dear old Frodo: you are miserable, because you don’t know how to say good-bye. You meant to leave the Shire,&#13;
         of course. But danger has come on you sooner than you expected, and now you are making up your mind to go at once. And you&#13;
         don’t want to. We are very sorry for you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo opened his mouth and shut it again. His look of surprise was so comical that they laughed. ‘Dear old Frodo!’ said Pippin.&#13;
         ‘Did you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful or clever enough for that! You&#13;
         have obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since April. We have constantly heard&#13;
         you muttering: “Shall I ever look down into that valley again, I wonder”, and things like that. And pretending that you had&#13;
         come to the end of your money, and actually selling your beloved Bag End to those Sackville-Bagginses! And all those close&#13;
         talks with Gandalf.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good heavens!’ said Frodo. ‘I thought I had been both careful and clever. I don’t know what Gandalf would say. Is all the&#13;
         Shire discussing my departure then?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh no!’ said Merry. ‘Don’t worry about that! The secret won’t keep for long, of course; but at present it is, I think, only&#13;
         known to us conspirators. After all, you must remember that we know you well, and are often with you. We can usually guess&#13;
         what you are thinking. I knew Bilbo, too. To tell you the truth, I have been watching you rather closely ever since he left.&#13;
         I thought you would go after him sooner or later; indeed I expected you to go sooner, and lately we have been very anxious.&#13;
         We have been terrified that you might give us the slip, and go off suddenly, all on your own like he did. Ever since this&#13;
         spring we have kept our eyes open, and done a good deal of planning on our own account. You are not going to escape so easily!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But I must go,’ said Frodo. ‘It cannot be helped, dear friends. It is wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying &#13;
         <a id="page136"/>to keep me. Since you have guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You do not understand!’ said Pippin. ‘You must go – and therefore we must, too. Merry and I are coming with you. Sam is an&#13;
         excellent fellow, and would jump down a dragon’s throat to save you, if he did not trip over his own feet; but you will need&#13;
         more than one companion in your dangerous adventure.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘My dear and most beloved hobbits!’ said Frodo deeply moved. ‘But I could not allow it. I decided that long ago, too. You&#13;
         speak of danger, but you do not understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and-back journey. I am flying from deadly peril&#13;
         into deadly peril.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of course we understand,’ said Merry firmly. ‘That is why we have decided to come. We know the Ring is no laughing-matter;&#13;
         but we are going to do our best to help you against the Enemy.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Ring!’ said Frodo, now completely amazed.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, the Ring,’ said Merry. ‘My dear old hobbit, you don’t allow for the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the&#13;
         existence of the Ring for years – before Bilbo went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded it as secret, I kept the&#13;
         knowledge in my head, until we formed our conspiracy. I did not know Bilbo, of course, as well as I know you; I was too young,&#13;
         and he was also more careful – but he was not careful enough. If you want to know how I first found out, I will tell you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Go on!’ said Frodo faintly.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was the Sackville-Bagginses that were his downfall, as you might expect. One day, a year before the Party, I happened&#13;
         to be walking along the road, when I saw Bilbo ahead. Suddenly in the distance the S.-B.s appeared, coming towards us. Bilbo&#13;
         slowed down, and then hey presto! he vanished. I was so startled that I hardly had the wits to hide myself in a more ordinary&#13;
         fashion; but I got through the hedge and walked along the field inside. I was peeping through into the road, after the S.-B.s&#13;
         had passed, and was looking straight at Bilbo &#13;
         <a id="page137"/>when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser-pocket.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘After that I kept my eyes open. In fact, I confess that I spied. But you must admit that it was very intriguing, and I was&#13;
         only in my teens. I must be the only one in the Shire, besides you Frodo, that has ever seen the old fellow’s secret book.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You have read his book!’ cried Frodo. ‘Good heavens above! Is nothing safe?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not too safe, I should say,’ said Merry. ‘But I have only had one rapid glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left&#13;
         the book about. I wonder what became of it. I should like another look. Have you got it, Frodo?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No. It was not at Bag End. He must have taken it away.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, as I was saying,’ Merry proceeded, ‘I kept my knowledge to myself, till this spring when things got serious. Then we&#13;
         formed our conspiracy; and as we were serious, too, and meant business, we have not been too scrupulous. You are not a very&#13;
         easy nut to crack, and Gandalf is worse. But if you want to be introduced to our chief investigator, I can produce him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where is he?’ said Frodo, looking round, as if he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Step forward, Sam!’ said Merry; and Sam stood up with a face scarlet up to the ears. ‘Here’s our collector of information!&#13;
         And he collected a lot, I can tell you, before he was finally caught. After which, I may say, he seemed to regard himself&#13;
         as on parole, and dried up.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Sam!’ cried Frodo, feeling that amazement could go no further, and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused,&#13;
         relieved, or merely foolish.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, sir!’ said Sam. ‘Begging your pardon, sir! But I meant no wrong to you, Mr. Frodo, nor to Mr. Gandalf for that matter.&#13;
         <em>He</em> has some sense, mind you; and when you said <em>go alone</em>, he said <em>no! take someone as you can trust</em>.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But it does not seem that I can trust anyone,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>Sam looked at him unhappily. ‘It all depends on what you &#13;
         <a id="page138"/>want,’ put in Merry. ‘You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin – to the bitter end. And you can trust us to&#13;
         keep any secret of yours – closer than you keep it yourself. But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go&#13;
         off without a word. We are your friends, Frodo. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what Gandalf has told you. We know a&#13;
         good deal about the Ring. We are horribly afraid – but we are coming with you; or following you like hounds.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And after all, sir,’ added Sam, ‘you did ought to take the Elves’ advice. Gildor said you should take them as was willing,&#13;
         and you can’t deny it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t deny it,’ said Frodo, looking at Sam, who was now grinning. ‘I don’t deny it, but I’ll never believe you are sleeping&#13;
         again, whether you snore or not. I shall kick you hard to make sure.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You are a set of deceitful scoundrels!’ he said, turning to the others. ‘But bless you!’ he laughed, getting up and waving&#13;
         his arms, ‘I give in. I will take Gildor’s advice. If the danger were not so dark, I should dance for joy. Even so, I cannot&#13;
         help feeling happy; happier than I have felt for a long time. I had dreaded this evening.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good! That’s settled. Three cheers for Captain Frodo and company!’ they shouted; and they danced round him. Merry and Pippin&#13;
         began a song, which they had apparently got ready for the occasion.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started Bilbo on his adventure long ago, and went to the same tune:</p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Farewell we call to hearth and hall!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Though wind may blow and rain may fall,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>We must away ere break of day</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Far over wood and mountain tall.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>To Rivendell, where Elves yet dwell</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>In glades beneath the misty fell,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Through moor and waste we ride in haste,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>And whither then we cannot tell.</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page139"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>With foes ahead, behind us dread,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Beneath the sky shall be our bed,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Until at last our toil be passed,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Our journey done, our errand sped.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>We must away! We must away!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>We ride before the break of day!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very good!’ said Frodo. ‘But in that case there are a lot of things to do before we go to bed – under a roof, for tonight&#13;
         at any rate.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh! That was poetry!’ said Pippin. ‘Do you really mean to start before the break of day?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know,’ answered Frodo. ‘I fear those Black Riders, and I am sure it is unsafe to stay in one place long, especially&#13;
         in a place to which it is known I was going. Also Gildor advised me not to wait. But I should very much like to see Gandalf.&#13;
         I could see that even Gildor was disturbed when he heard that Gandalf had never appeared. It really depends on two things.&#13;
         How soon could the Riders get to Bucklebury? And how soon could we get off? It will take a good deal of preparation.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The answer to the second question,’ said Merry, ‘is that we could get off in an hour. I have prepared practically everything.&#13;
         There are five ponies in a stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except for a few extra clothes, and&#13;
         the perishable food.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,’ said Frodo. ‘But what about the Black Riders? Would it be safe to wait&#13;
         one day for Gandalf?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That all depends on what you think the Riders would do, if they found you here,’ answered Merry. ‘They <em>could</em> have reached here by now, of course, if they were not stopped at the North-gate, where the Hedge runs down to the riverbank,&#13;
         just this side of the Bridge. The gate-guards would not let them through by night, though they might break through. Even in&#13;
         the daylight they would try to keep them out, I think, &#13;
         <a id="page140"/>at any rate until they got a message through to the Master of the Hall – for they would not like the look of the Riders, and&#13;
         would certainly be frightened by them. But, of course, Buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible&#13;
         that in the morning even a Black Rider that rode up and asked for Mr. Baggins would be let through. It is pretty generally&#13;
         known that you are coming back to live at Crickhollow.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Frodo sat for a while in thought. ‘I have made up my mind,’ he said finally. ‘I am starting tomorrow, as soon as it is light.&#13;
         But I am not going by road: it would be safer to wait here than that. If I go through the North-gate my departure from Buckland&#13;
         will be known at once, instead of being secret for several days at least, as it might be. And what is more, the Bridge and&#13;
         the East Road near the borders will certainly be watched, whether any Rider gets into Buckland or not. We don’t know how many&#13;
         there are; but there are at least two, and possibly more. The only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But that can only mean going into the Old Forest!’ said Fredegar horrified. ‘You can’t be thinking of doing that. It is quite&#13;
         as dangerous as Black Riders.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not quite,’ said Merry. ‘It sounds very desperate, but I believe Frodo is right. It is the only way of getting off without&#13;
         being followed at once. With luck we might get a considerable start.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But you won’t have any luck in the Old Forest,’ objected Fredegar. ‘No one ever has luck in there. You’ll get lost. People&#13;
         don’t go in there.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh yes they do!’ said Merry. ‘The Brandybucks go in – occasionally when the fit takes them. We have a private entrance. Frodo&#13;
         went in once, long ago. I have been in several times: usually in daylight, of course, when the trees are sleepy and fairly&#13;
         quiet.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, do as you think best!’ said Fredegar. ‘I am more afraid of the Old Forest than of anything I know about: the &#13;
         <a id="page141"/>stories about it are a nightmare; but my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey. Still, I am very glad someone&#13;
         is stopping behind, who can tell Gandalf what you have done, when he turns up, as I am sure he will before long.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Fond as he was of Frodo, Fatty Bolger had no desire to leave the Shire, nor to see what lay outside it. His family came from&#13;
         the Eastfarthing, from Budgeford in Bridgefields in fact, but he had never been over the Brandywine Bridge. His task, according&#13;
         to the original plans of the conspirators, was to stay behind and deal with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as possible&#13;
         the pretence that Mr. Baggins was still living at Crickhollow. He had even brought along some old clothes of Frodo’s to help&#13;
         him in playing the part. They little thought how dangerous that part might prove.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Excellent!’ said Frodo, when he understood the plan. ‘We could not have left any message behind for Gandalf otherwise. I&#13;
         don’t know whether these Riders can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to risk a written message, in case&#13;
         they got in and searched the house. But if Fatty is willing to hold the fort, and I can be sure of Gandalf knowing the way&#13;
         we have gone, that decides me. I am going into the Old Forest first thing tomorrow.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, that’s that,’ said Pippin. ‘On the whole I would rather have our job than Fatty’s – waiting here till Black Riders&#13;
         come.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You wait till you are well inside the Forest,’ said Fredegar. ‘You’ll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It’s no good arguing about it any more,’ said Merry. ‘We have still got to tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing,&#13;
         before we get to bed. I shall call you all before the break of day.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">When at last he had got to bed, Frodo could not sleep for some time. His legs ached. He was glad that he was riding in the&#13;
         morning. Eventually he fell into a vague dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark &#13;
         <a id="page142"/>sea of tangled trees. Down below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling. He felt sure they&#13;
         would smell him out sooner or later.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then he heard a noise in the distance. At first he thought it was a great wind coming over the leaves of the forest. Then&#13;
         he knew that it was not leaves, but the sound of the Sea far-off; a sound he had never heard in waking life, though it had&#13;
         often troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he was out in the open. There were no trees after all. He was on a dark heath,&#13;
         and there was a strange salt smell in the air. Looking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing alone on a high ridge.&#13;
         A great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the Sea. He started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower: but&#13;
         suddenly a light came in the sky, and there was a noise of thunder.&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-6">THE OLD FOREST</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">Frodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in the room. Merry was standing there with a candle in one hand, and banging on the&#13;
         door with the other. ‘All right! What is it?’ said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What is it!’ cried Merry. ‘It is time to get up. It is half past four and very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast&#13;
         ready. Even Pippin is up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be the baggage-carrier. Wake&#13;
         that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up and see us off.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Soon after six o’clock the five hobbits were ready to start. Fatty Bolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out of the&#13;
         house. Merry went in front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that went through a spinney behind the house,&#13;
         and then cut across several fields. The leaves of trees were glistening, and every twig was dripping; the grass was grey with&#13;
         cold dew. Everything was still, and far-away noises seemed near and clear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone closing a door&#13;
         of a distant house.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In their shed they found the ponies: sturdy little beasts of the kind loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long day’s&#13;
         work. They mounted, and soon they were riding off into the mist, which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly&#13;
         behind them. After riding for about an hour, slowly and without talking, they saw the Hedge looming suddenly ahead. It was&#13;
         tall and netted over with silver cobwebs.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘How are you going to get through this?’ asked Fredegar.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Follow me!’ said Merry, ‘and you will see.’ He turned to the left along the Hedge, and soon they came to a point where it&#13;
         bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A cutting &#13;
         <a id="page144"/>had been made, at some distance from the Hedge, and went sloping gently down into the ground. It had walls of brick at the&#13;
         sides, which rose steadily, until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the Hedge and came out&#13;
         in the hollow on the other side.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Here Fatty Bolger halted. ‘Good-bye, Frodo!’ he said. ‘I wish you were not going into the Forest. I only hope you will not&#13;
         need rescuing before the day is out. But good luck to you – today and every day!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be lucky,’ said Frodo. ‘Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East&#13;
         Road: we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can.’ ‘Good-bye!’ they cried, and rode down the slope and disappeared&#13;
         from Fredegar’s sight into the tunnel.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate of thick-set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate,&#13;
         and when they had all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock clicked. The sound was ominous.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There!’ said Merry. ‘You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and on the edge of the Old Forest.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Are the stories about it true?’ asked Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know what stories you mean,’ Merry answered. ‘If you mean the old bogey-stories Fatty’s nurses used to tell him,&#13;
         about goblins and wolves and things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I don’t believe them. But the Forest <em>is</em> queer. Everything in it is very much more alive, more aware of what is going on, so to speak, than things are in the Shire.&#13;
         And the trees do not like strangers. They watch you. They are usually content merely to watch you, as long as daylight lasts,&#13;
         and don’t do much. Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, or stick a root out, or grasp at you with a long&#13;
         trailer. But at night things can be most alarming, or so I am told. I have only once or twice been in here after dark, and&#13;
         then only near the hedge. I thought all the trees were whispering to each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible&#13;
         language; and the &#13;
         <a id="page145"/>branches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the trees do actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them&#13;
         in. In fact long ago they attacked the Hedge: they came and planted themselves right by it, and leaned over it. But the hobbits&#13;
         came and cut down hundreds of trees, and made a great bonfire in the Forest, and burned all the ground in a long strip east&#13;
         of the Hedge. After that the trees gave up the attack, but they became very unfriendly. There is still a wide bare space not&#13;
         far inside where the bonfire was made.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Is it only the trees that are dangerous?’ asked Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and on the far side,’ said Merry, ‘or at least I have heard so;&#13;
         but I have never seen any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks; but they seem&#13;
         to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the beginning&#13;
         of quite a broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade, and then on more or less in our direction, east and a little north. That&#13;
         is the path I am going to try and find.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow. On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the&#13;
         floor of the Forest, a hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees.&#13;
         Looking back they could see the dark line of the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them. Looking&#13;
         ahead they could see only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender,&#13;
         smooth or gnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and slimy, shaggy growths.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Merry alone seemed fairly cheerful. ‘You had better lead on and find that path,’ Frodo said to him. ‘Don’t let us lose one&#13;
         another, or forget which way the Hedge lies!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots.&#13;
         There was no undergrowth. The ground &#13;
         <a id="page146"/>was rising steadily, and as they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller, darker, and thicker. There was no sound,&#13;
         except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leaves. For the moment there was no whispering or movement&#13;
         among the branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval, deepening to&#13;
         dislike and even enmity. The feeling steadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing back over&#13;
         their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way. Pippin suddenly felt that he could&#13;
         not bear it any longer, and without warning let out a shout. ‘Oi! Oi!’ he cried. ‘I am not going to do anything. Just let&#13;
         me pass through, will you!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain. There was no echo or answer though the wood&#13;
         seemed to become more crowded and more watchful than before.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I should not shout, if I were you,’ said Merry. ‘It does more harm than good.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if he had been right to make the others come into this&#13;
         abominable wood. Merry was looking from side to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go. Pippin noticed it. ‘It&#13;
         has not taken you long to lose us,’ he said. But at that moment Merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, well!’ he said. ‘These trees <em>do</em> shift. There is the Bonfire Glade in front of us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved away!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came out of the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space.&#13;
         There was sky above them, blue and clear to their surprise, for down under the Forest-roof they had not been able to see the&#13;
         rising morning and the lifting of the mist. The sun was not, however, high enough yet to shine down into &#13;
         <a id="page147"/>the clearing, though its light was on the tree-tops. The leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade,&#13;
         enclosing it with an almost solid wall. No tree grew there, only rough grass and many tall plants: stalky and faded hemlocks&#13;
         and wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and rampant nettles and thistles. A dreary place: but it seemed a charming&#13;
         and cheerful garden after the close Forest.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the sky. At the far side of the glade there&#13;
         was a break in the wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They could see it running on into the wood, wide in places and&#13;
         open above, though every now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. Up this path they rode.&#13;
         They were still climbing gently, but they now went much quicker, and with better heart; for it seemed to them that the Forest&#13;
         had relented, and was going to let them pass unhindered after all.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. The trees drew close again on either side, and they could no longer&#13;
         see far ahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them. So silent was it that the&#13;
         fall of their ponies’ hoofs, rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud in their ears.&#13;
         Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank to a murmur.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>O! Wanderers in the shadowed land</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>despair not! For though dark they stand,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>all woods there be must end at last,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>and see the open sun go past:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>the setting sun, the rising sun</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>the day’s end, or the day begun.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>For east or west all woods must fail...</em></p>&#13;
      <p><em>Fail</em> – even as he said the word his voice faded into silence. The air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome. Just behind&#13;
         them a large branch fell from an old overhanging &#13;
         <a id="page148"/>tree with a crash into the path. The trees seemed to close in before them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘They do not like all that about ending and failing,’ said Merry. ‘I should not sing any more at present. Wait till we do&#13;
         get to the edge, and then we’ll turn and give them a rousing chorus!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show it. The others did not answer. They were depressed.&#13;
         A heavy weight was settling steadily on Frodo’s heart, and he regretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought&#13;
         of challenging the menace of the trees. He was, indeed, just about to stop and propose going back (if that was still possible),&#13;
         when things took a new turn. The path stopped climbing, and became for a while nearly level. The dark trees drew aside, and&#13;
         ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward. Before them, but some distance off, there stood a green hill-top,&#13;
         treeless, rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood. The path seemed to be making directly for it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought of climbing out for a while above the roof of the Forest. The path&#13;
         dipped, and then again began to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside. There it left the trees&#13;
         and faded into the turf. The wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until they reached the top. There they stood and gazed about them.&#13;
         The air was gleaming and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. Near at hand the mist was now almost&#13;
         gone; though here and there it lay in hollows of the wood, and to the south of them, out of a deep fold cutting right across&#13;
         the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That,’ said Merry, pointing with his hand, ‘that is the line of the Withywindle. It comes down out of the Downs and &#13;
         <a id="page149"/>flows south-west through the midst of the Forest to join the Brandywine below Haysend. We don’t want to go <em>that</em> way! The Withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the whole wood – the centre from which all the queerness comes,&#13;
         as it were.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The others looked in the direction that Merry pointed out, but they could see little but mists over the damp and deep-cut&#13;
         valley; and beyond it the southern half of the Forest faded from view.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The sun on the hill-top was now getting hot. It must have been about eleven o’clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them&#13;
         from seeing much in other directions. In the west they could not make out either the line of the Hedge or the valley of the&#13;
         Brandywine beyond it. Northward, where they looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of the great&#13;
         East Road, for which they were making. They were on an island in a sea of trees, and the horizon was veiled.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>On the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees,&#13;
         like island-shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters. They sat on the green edge and looked&#13;
         out over the woods below them, while they ate their mid-day meal. As the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in&#13;
         the east the grey-green lines of the Downs that lay beyond the Old Forest on that side. That cheered them greatly; for it&#13;
         was good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood’s borders, though they did not mean to go that way, if they could help&#13;
         it: the Barrow-downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbit-legend as the Forest itself.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At length they made up their minds to go on again. The path that had brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward&#13;
         side; but they had not followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right. Soon it began to&#13;
         descend rapidly and they guessed that it must actually be heading towards the Withywindle valley: not at all the &#13;
         <a id="page150"/>direction they wished to take. After some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward; for&#13;
         although they had not been able to see it from the hill-top, the Road must lie that way, and it could not be many miles off.&#13;
         Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed to be drier and more open, climbing up to slopes where the trees&#13;
         were thinner, and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the denser wood.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair speed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in&#13;
         an open glade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But after a time the trees began to close in again, just&#13;
         where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and less tangled. Then deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly,&#13;
         like the ruts of great giant-wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and choked with brambles. These lay usually&#13;
         right across their line of march, and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again, which was troublesome and difficult&#13;
         with their ponies. Each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted undergrowth, which&#13;
         somehow would not yield to the left, but only gave way when they turned to the right; and they had to go some distance along&#13;
         the bottom before they could find a way up the further bank. Each time they clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and darker;&#13;
         and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the right and downwards.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">After an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of direction, though they knew well enough that they had long ceased to&#13;
         go northward at all. They were being headed off, and were simply following a course chosen for them – eastwards and southwards,&#13;
         into the heart of the Forest and not out of it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet&#13;
         met. It was so steep and overhung that it proved &#13;
         <a id="page151"/>impossible to climb out of it again, either forwards or backwards, without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind.&#13;
         All they could do was to follow the fold – downwards. The ground grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks,&#13;
         and soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed. Then the ground began to fall&#13;
         rapidly, and the brook growing strong and noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully over-arched&#13;
         by trees high above them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After stumbling along for some way along the stream, they came quite suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate they&#13;
         saw the sunlight before them. Coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high&#13;
         steep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another&#13;
         bank almost as steep. A golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between. In the midst of&#13;
         it there wound lazily a dark river of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with willows, blocked with fallen&#13;
         willows, and flecked with thousands of faded willow-leaves. The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from the branches;&#13;
         for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were&#13;
         creaking.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!’ said Merry. ‘We have come almost in the opposite direction to which&#13;
         we intended. This is the River Withywindle! I will go on and explore.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses. After a while he reappeared, and reported that there&#13;
         was fairly solid ground between the cliff-foot and the river; in some places firm turf went down to the water’s edge. ‘What’s&#13;
         more,’ he said, ‘there seems to be something like a footpath winding along on this side of the river. If we turn left and&#13;
         follow it, we shall be bound to come out on the east side of the Forest eventually.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I dare say!’ said Pippin. ‘That is, if the track goes on so &#13;
         <a id="page152"/>far, and does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there. Who made the track, do you suppose, and why? I am sure it&#13;
         was not for our benefit. I am getting very suspicious of this Forest and everything in it, and I begin to believe all the&#13;
         stories about it. And have you any idea how far eastward we should have to go?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No,’ said Merry, ‘I haven’t. I don’t know in the least how far down the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly come here&#13;
         often enough to make a path along it. But there is no other way out that I can see or think of.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There being nothing else for it, they filed out, and Merry led them to the path that he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds&#13;
         and grasses were lush and tall, in places far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy to follow, as it turned&#13;
         and twisted, picking out the sounder ground among the bogs and pools. Here and there it passed over other rills, running down&#13;
         gullies into the Withywindle out of the higher forest-lands, and at these points there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood&#13;
         laid carefully across.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round their ears, and the afternoon sun&#13;
         was burning on their backs. At last they came suddenly into a thin shade; great grey branches reached across the path. Each&#13;
         step forward became more reluctant than the last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up their legs, and&#13;
         falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod. Just in front of him Pippin fell forward on to his knees. Frodo halted. ‘It’s&#13;
         no good,’ he heard Merry saying. ‘Can’t go another step without rest. Must have nap. It’s cool under the willows. Less flies!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo did not like the sound of this. ‘Come on!’ he cried. ‘We can’t have a nap yet. We must get clear of the Forest first.’&#13;
         But the others were too far gone to care. Beside them Sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly Frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His &#13;
         <a id="page153"/>head swam. There now seemed hardly a sound in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing. Only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing,&#13;
         a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered, seemed to stir in the boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning&#13;
         over him a huge willow-tree, old and hoary. Enormous it looked, its sprawling branches going up like reaching arms with many&#13;
         long-fingered hands, its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved. The leaves&#13;
         fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon the grass.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Merry and Pippin dragged themselves forward and lay down with their backs to the willow-trunk. Behind them the great cracks&#13;
         gaped wide to receive them as the tree swayed and creaked. They looked up at the grey and yellow leaves, moving softly against&#13;
         the light, and singing. They shut their eyes, and then it seemed that they could almost hear words, cool words, saying something&#13;
         about water and sleep. They gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowering him; then with an effort he struggled to his feet again.&#13;
         He felt a compelling desire for cool water. ‘Wait for me, Sam,’ he stammered. ‘Must bathe feet a minute.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Half in a dream he wandered forward to the riverward side of the tree, where great winding roots grew out into the stream,&#13;
         like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink. He straddled one of these, and paddled his hot feet in the cool brown water;&#13;
         and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against the tree.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Sam sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern. He was worried. The afternoon was getting late, and he thought&#13;
         this sudden sleepiness uncanny. ‘There’s more behind this than sun and warm air,’ he muttered to himself. ‘I don’t like this&#13;
         great big tree. I don’t trust it. Hark at it singing about sleep now! This won’t do at all!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page154"/>He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become of the ponies. He found that two had wandered on a&#13;
         good way along the path; and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others, when he heard two noises; one&#13;
         loud, and the other soft but very clear. One was the splash of something heavy falling into the water; the other was a noise&#13;
         like the snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He rushed back to the bank. Frodo was in the water close to the edge, and a great tree-root seemed to be over him and holding&#13;
         him down, but he was not struggling. Sam gripped him by the jacket, and dragged him from under the root; and then with difficulty&#13;
         hauled him on to the bank. Almost at once he woke, and coughed and spluttered.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do you know, Sam,’ he said at length, ‘the beastly tree <em>threw</em> me in! I felt it. The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You were dreaming I expect, Mr. Frodo,’ said Sam. ‘You shouldn’t sit in such a place, if you feel sleepy.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘What about the others?’ Frodo asked. ‘I wonder what sort of dreams they are having.’</p>&#13;
      <p>They went round to the other side of the tree, and then Sam understood the click that he had heard. Pippin had vanished. The&#13;
         crack by which he had laid himself had closed together, so that not a chink could be seen. Merry was trapped: another crack&#13;
         had closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, but the rest of him was inside a dark opening, the edges of which gripped&#13;
         like a pair of pincers.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo and Sam beat first upon the tree-trunk where Pippin had lain. They then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws&#13;
         of the crack that held poor Merry. It was quite useless.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What a foul thing to happen!’ cried Frodo wildly. ‘Why did we ever come into this dreadful Forest? I wish we were all back&#13;
         at Crickhollow!’ He kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless of his own feet. A hardly perceptible shiver ran through&#13;
         the stem and up into the branches; the leaves rustled and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page155"/>‘I suppose we haven’t got an axe among our luggage, Mr. Frodo?’ asked Sam.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,’ said Frodo. ‘That wouldn’t be much use.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Wait a minute!’ cried Sam, struck by an idea suggested by firewood. ‘We might do something with fire!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We might,’ said Frodo doubtfully. ‘We might succeed in roasting Pippin alive inside.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,’ said Sam fiercely. ‘If it don’t let them go, I’ll have it down,&#13;
         if I have to gnaw it.’ He ran to the ponies and before long came back with two tinder-boxes and a hatchet.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks. These they&#13;
         heaped against the trunk on the far side of the tree from the prisoners. As soon as Sam had struck a spark into the tinder,&#13;
         it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of flame and smoke went up. The twigs crackled. Little fingers of fire licked against&#13;
         the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and scorched it. A tremor ran through the whole willow. The leaves seemed to hiss&#13;
         above their heads with a sound of pain and anger. A loud scream came from Merry, and from far inside the tree they heard Pippin&#13;
         give a muffled yell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Put it out! Put it out!’ cried Merry. ‘He’ll squeeze me in two, if you don’t. He says so!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who? What?’ shouted Frodo, rushing round to the other side of the tree.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Put it out! Put it out!’ begged Merry. The branches of the willow began to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind&#13;
         rising and spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about, as though they had dropped a stone into&#13;
         the quiet slumber of the river-valley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the whole Forest. Sam kicked at the little&#13;
         fire and stamped out the sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of why he did so, or what he hoped for, ran along the path&#13;
         crying <em>help! help! help!</em> It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice: it was &#13;
         <a id="page156"/>blown away from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a clamour of leaves, as soon as the words left his mouth. He felt desperate:&#13;
         lost and witless.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly he stopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; but it seemed to come from behind him, away down the path further&#13;
         back in the Forest. He turned round and listened, and soon there could be no doubt: someone was singing a song; a deep glad&#13;
         voice was singing carelessly and happily, but it was singing nonsense:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>Half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo and Sam now both stood still. Suddenly out of a long string of nonsense-words&#13;
         (or so they seemed) the voice rose up loud and clear and burst into this song:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My darling!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Down along under Hill, shining in the sunlight,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>There my pretty lady is, River-woman’s daughter,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Slender as the willow-wand, clearer than the water.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Old Tom Bombadil water-lilies bringing</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! and merry-o,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Goldberry, Goldberry, merry yellow berry-o!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Poor old Willow-man, you tuck your roots away!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Tom’s in a hurry now. Evening will follow day.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Tom’s going home again water-lilies bringing.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Hey! Come derry dol! Can you hear me singing?</em></p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves hung silently again on stiff branches. There was another&#13;
         burst of song, and then suddenly, hopping and &#13;
         <a id="page157"/>dancing along the path, there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck&#13;
         in the band. With another hop and a bound there came into view a man, or so it seemed. At any rate he was too large and heavy&#13;
         for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for one of the Big People, though he made noise enough for one, stumping along with&#13;
         great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue&#13;
         coat and a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face was red as a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred&#13;
         wrinkles of laughter. In his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white water-lilies.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Help!’ cried Frodo and Sam running towards him with their hands stretched out.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Whoa! Whoa! steady there!’ cried the old man, holding up one hand, and they stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff.&#13;
         ‘Now, my little fellows, where be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows? What’s the matter here then? Do you know who I am?&#13;
         I’m Tom Bombadil. Tell me what’s your trouble! Tom’s in a hurry now. Don’t you crush my lilies!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘My friends are caught in the willow-tree,’ cried Frodo breathlessly.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Master Merry’s being squeezed in a crack!’ cried Sam. ‘What?’ shouted Tom Bombadil, leaping up in the air. ‘Old Man Willow?&#13;
         Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for him. Old grey Willow-man! I’ll freeze his marrow&#13;
         cold, if he don’t behave himself. I’ll sing his roots off. I’ll sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away. Old Man Willow!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Setting down his lilies carefully on the grass, he ran to the tree. There he saw Merry’s feet still sticking out – the rest&#13;
         had already been drawn further inside. Tom put his mouth to the crack and began singing into it in a low voice. They could&#13;
         not catch the words, but evidently Merry was aroused. His legs began to kick. Tom sprang away, and breaking off a hanging&#13;
         branch smote the side of the willow with it. ‘You let them out again, Old Man Willow!’ he said. ‘What be you &#13;
         <a id="page158"/>a-thinking of? You should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! Go to sleep! Bombadil is talking!’ He then seized&#13;
         Merry’s feet and drew him out of the suddenly widening crack.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There was a tearing creak and the other crack split open, and out of it Pippin sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then with&#13;
         a loud snap both cracks closed fast again. A shudder ran through the tree from root to tip, and complete silence fell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Thank you!’ said the hobbits, one after the other.</p>&#13;
      <p>Tom Bombadil burst out laughing. ‘Well, my little fellows!’ said he, stooping so that he peered into their faces. ‘You shall&#13;
         come home with me! The table is all laden with yellow cream, honeycomb, and white bread and butter. Goldberry is waiting.&#13;
         Time enough for questions around the supper table. You follow after me as quick as you are able!’ With that he picked up his&#13;
         lilies, and then with a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward, still singing loudly&#13;
         and nonsensically.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Too surprised and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed after him as fast as they could. But that was not fast enough.&#13;
         Tom soon disappeared in front of them, and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away. Suddenly his voice came&#13;
         floating back to them in a loud halloo!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Hop along, my little friends, up the Withywindle!</em></p>&#13;
 <p class="vext"><em>Tom’s going on ahead candles for to kindle.</em></p>&#13;
 <p class="vext"><em>Down west sinks the Sun: soon you will be groping.</em></p>&#13;
 <p class="vext"><em>When the night-shadows fall, then the door will open,</em></p>&#13;
<p class="vext"><em>Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow.</em></p>&#13;
            <p class="vext"><em>Fear no alder black! Heed no hoary willow!</em></p>&#13;
<p class="vext"><em>Fear neither root nor bough! Tom goes on before you.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="vext-3"><em>Hey now! merry dol! We’ll&#13;
            be waiting for you!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>After that the hobbits heard no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behind them. They thought of the&#13;
         slanting light of evening glittering on the Brandywine River, and the windows of Bucklebury beginning to gleam &#13;
         <a id="page159"/>with hundreds of lights. Great shadows fell across them; trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path.&#13;
         White mists began to rise and curl on the surface of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders. Out&#13;
         of the very ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their legs seemed leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among&#13;
         the bushes and reeds on either side of them; and if they looked up to the pale sky, they caught sight of queer gnarled and&#13;
         knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight, and leered down at them from the high bank and the edges of the wood.&#13;
         They began to feel that all this country was unreal, and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no&#13;
         awakening.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed that the ground was gently rising. The water began&#13;
         to murmur. In the darkness they caught the white glimmer of foam, where the river flowed over a short fall. Then suddenly&#13;
         the trees came to an end and the mists were left behind. They stepped out from the Forest, and found a wide sweep of grass&#13;
         welling up before them. The river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily down to meet them, glinting here and there in&#13;
         the light of the stars, which were already shining in the sky.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown or shaven. The eaves of the Forest behind were clipped,&#13;
         and trim as a hedge. The path was now plain before them, well-tended and bordered with stone. It wound up on to the top of&#13;
         a grassy knoll, now grey under the pale starry night; and there, still high above them on a further slope, they saw the twinkling&#13;
         lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up again, up a long smooth hillside of turf, towards the light. Suddenly&#13;
         a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened. There was Tom Bombadil’s house before them, up, down,&#13;
         under hill. Behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey and bare, and &#13;
         <a id="page160"/>beyond that the dark shapes of the Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They all hurried forward, hobbits and ponies. Already half their weariness and all their fears had fallen from them. <em>Hey! Come merry dol!</em> rolled out the song to greet them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Hey! Come derry dol! Hop along, my hearties!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Hobbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>Then another clear voice, as young and as ancient as Spring, like the song of a glad water flowing down into the night from&#13;
         a bright morning in the hills, came falling like silver to meet them:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Now let the song begin! Let us sing together</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Reeds by the shady pool, lilies on the water:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>And with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and a golden light was all about them.</p>&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-7">IN THE HOUSE OF TOM BOMBADIL</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">The four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold, and stood still, blinking. They were in a long low room, filled with&#13;
         the light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof; and on the table of dark polished wood stood many candles, tall and&#13;
         yellow, burning brightly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In a chair, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a woman. Her long yellow hair rippled down her shoulders;&#13;
         her gown was green, green as young reeds, shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was of gold, shaped like a chain&#13;
         of flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of forget-me-nots. About her feet in wide vessels of green and brown earthenware,&#13;
         white water-lilies were floating, so that she seemed to be enthroned in the midst of a pool.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Enter, good guests!’ she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was her clear voice they had heard singing. They came a&#13;
         few timid steps further into the room, and began to bow low, feeling strangely surprised and awkward, like folk that, knocking&#13;
         at a cottage door to beg for a drink of water, have been answered by a fair young elf-queen clad in living flowers. But before&#13;
         they could say anything, she sprang lightly up and over the lily-bowls, and ran laughing towards them; and as she ran her&#13;
         gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowering borders of a river.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come dear folk!’ she said, taking Frodo by the hand. ‘Laugh and be merry! I am Goldberry, daughter of the River.’ Then lightly&#13;
         she passed them and closing the door she turned her back to it, with her white arms spread out across it. ‘Let us shut out&#13;
         the night!’ she said. ‘For you are still afraid, perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things. Fear&#13;
         nothing! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page162"/>The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and smiled. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ said Frodo at last,&#13;
         feeling his heart moved with a joy that he did not understand. He stood as he had at times stood enchanted by fair elven-voices;&#13;
         but the spell that was now laid upon him was different: less keen and lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to mortal&#13;
         heart; marvellous and yet not strange. ‘Fair lady Goldberry!’ he said again. ‘Now the joy that was hidden in the songs we&#13;
         heard is made plain to me.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>O slender as a willow-wand! O clearer than clear water!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>O reed by the living pool! Fair River-daughter!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>O spring-time and summer-time, and spring again after!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves’ laughter!’</em></p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surprise to hear himself saying such things. But Goldberry laughed.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Welcome!’ she said. ‘I had not heard that folk of the Shire were so sweet-tongued. But I see that you are an Elf-friend;&#13;
         the light in your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting! Sit now, and wait for the Master of the&#13;
         house! He will not be long. He is tending your tired beasts.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated chairs, while Goldberry busied herself about the table; and their eyes followed&#13;
         her, for the slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere behind the house came the sound&#13;
         of singing. Every now and again they caught, among many a <em>derry dol</em> and a <em>merry dol</em> and a <em>ring a ding dillo</em> the repeated words:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>‘Fair lady!’ said Frodo again after a while. ‘Tell me, if my asking does not seem foolish, who is Tom Bombadil?’</p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page163"/>‘He is,’ said Goldberry, staying her swift movements and smiling.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo looked at her questioningly. ‘He is, as you have seen him,’ she said in answer to his look. ‘He is the Master of wood,&#13;
         water, and hill.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then all this strange land belongs to him?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No indeed!’ she answered, and her smile faded. ‘That would indeed be a burden,’ she added in a low voice, as if to herself.&#13;
         ‘The trees and the grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to themselves. Tom Bombadil is the Master.&#13;
         No one has ever caught old Tom walking in the forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under light and shadow.&#13;
         He has no fear. Tom Bombadil is master.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>A door opened and in came Tom Bombadil. He had now no hat and his thick brown hair was crowned with autumn leaves. He laughed,&#13;
         and going to Goldberry, took her hand.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here’s my pretty lady!’ he said, bowing to the hobbits. ‘Here’s my Goldberry clothed all in silver-green with flowers in&#13;
         her girdle! Is the table laden? I see yellow cream and honeycomb, and white bread, and butter; milk, cheese, and green herbs&#13;
         and ripe berries gathered. Is that enough for us? Is the supper ready?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is,’ said Goldberry; ‘but the guests perhaps are not?’</p>&#13;
      <p>Tom clapped his hands and cried: ‘Tom, Tom! your guests are tired, and you had near forgotten! Come now, my merry friends,&#13;
         and Tom will refresh you! You shall clean grimy hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your muddy cloaks and comb out&#13;
         your tangles!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn. They came to a low room with a sloping&#13;
         roof (a penthouse, it seemed, built on to the north end of the house). Its walls were of clean stone, but they were mostly&#13;
         covered with green hanging mats and yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green rushes. There were&#13;
         four deep mattresses, each piled with white blankets, laid on the floor along one side. Against the opposite wall was a long&#13;
         bench laden with wide earthenware &#13;
         <a id="page164"/>basins, and beside it stood brown ewers filled with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set&#13;
         ready beside each bed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Before long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the table, two on each side, while at either end sat Goldberry&#13;
         and the Master. It was a long and merry meal. Though the hobbits ate, as only famished hobbits can eat, there was no lack.&#13;
         The drink in their drinking-bowls seemed to be clear cold water, yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their&#13;
         voices. The guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily, as if it was easier and more natural than talking.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At last Tom and Goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly. The guests were commanded to sit quiet, and were set in chairs,&#13;
         each with a footstool to his tired feet. There was a fire in the wide hearth before them, and it was burning with a sweet&#13;
         smell, as if it were built of apple-wood. When everything was set in order, all the lights in the room were put out, except&#13;
         one lamp and a pair of candles at each end of the chimney-shelf. Then Goldberry came and stood before them, holding a candle;&#13;
         and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Have peace now,’ she said, ‘until the morning! Heed no nightly noises! For nothing passes door and window here save moonlight&#13;
         and starlight and the wind off the hill-top. Good night!’ She passed out of the room with a glimmer and a rustle. The sound&#13;
         of her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Tom sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of them tried to muster the courage to ask one of the many questions&#13;
         he had meant to ask at supper. Sleep gathered on their eyelids. At last Frodo spoke:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Did you hear me calling, Master, or was it just chance that brought you at that moment?’</p>&#13;
      <p>Tom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. ‘Eh, what?’ said he. ‘Did I hear you calling? Nay, I did not &#13;
         <a id="page165"/>hear: I was busy singing. Just chance brought me then, if chance you call it. It was no plan of mine, though I was waiting&#13;
         for you. We heard news of you, and learned that you were wandering. We guessed you’d come ere long down to the water: all&#13;
         paths lead that way, down to Withywindle. Old grey Willow-man, he’s a mighty singer; and it’s hard for little folk to escape&#13;
         his cunning mazes. But Tom had an errand there, that he dared not hinder.’ Tom nodded as if sleep was taking him again; but&#13;
         he went on in a soft singing voice:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>I had an errand there: gathering water-lilies,</em></p>&#13;
<p class="vext"><em>green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,</em></p>&#13;
<p class="vext"><em>the last ere the year’s&#13;
            end to keep them from the winter,</em></p><p class="vext"><em> to flower by her pretty feet till the snows are melted.</em></p><p class="vext"><em>Each year at summer’s end I go to&#13;
            find them for her,</em></p><p class="vext"><em>in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down Withywindle;</em></p><p class="vext"><em> there they open first in spring and there they linger&#13;
            latest.</em></p><p class="vext"><em> By that pool long ago I found the River-daughter,</em></p><p class="vext"><em>fair young Goldberry sitting in the rushes.</em></p><p class="vext-3"><em>Sweet was her singing&#13;
            then, and her heart was beating!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="p1">He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue:</p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>And that proved well for you – for now I shall no longer</em></p><p class="vext"><em>go down deep again along the forest-water,</em></p><p class="vext"><em>not while the year is&#13;
            old. Nor shall I be passing</em></p><p class="vext"><em>Old Man Willow’s house this side of spring-time,</em></p><p class="vext"><em>not till the merry spring, when the River-daughter</em></p><p class="vext-3"><em>dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>He fell silent again; but Frodo could not help asking one more question: the one he most desired to have answered. ‘Tell us,&#13;
         Master,’ he said, ‘about the Willow-man. What is he? I have never heard of him before.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, don’t!’ said Merry and Pippin together, sitting suddenly upright. ‘Not now! Not until the morning!’</p>&#13;
      <p>&#13;
         <a id="page166"/>‘That is right!’ said the old man. ‘Now is the time for resting. Some things are ill to hear when the world’s in shadow. Sleep&#13;
         till the morning-light, rest on the pillow! Heed no nightly noise! Fear no grey willow!’ And with that he took down the lamp&#13;
         and blew it out, and grasping a candle in either hand he led them out of the room.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were of white wool. They had hardly laid themselves on the&#13;
         deep beds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">In the dead night, Frodo lay in a dream without light. Then he saw the young moon rising; under its thin light there loomed&#13;
         before him a black wall of rock, pierced by a dark arch like a great gate. It seemed to Frodo that he was lifted up, and passing&#13;
         over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of hills, and that within it was a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood&#13;
         a pinnacle of stone, like a vast tower but not made by hands. On its top stood the figure of a man. The moon as it rose seemed&#13;
         to hang for a moment above his head and glistened in his white hair as the wind stirred it. Up from the dark plain below came&#13;
         the crying of fell voices, and the howling of many wolves. Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed across&#13;
         the moon. The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that he wielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore&#13;
         him away. The voices wailed and the wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it was borne the&#13;
         sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the East. ‘Black Riders!’ thought Frodo as he wakened, with the sound&#13;
         of the hoofs still echoing in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone&#13;
         walls. He lay motionless, still listening; but all was now silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep again or wandered&#13;
         into some other unremembered dream.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly &#13;
         <a id="page167"/>he woke, or thought he had waked, and yet still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream: <em>tip-tap</em>, <em>squeak</em>: the noise was like branches fretting in the wind, twig-fingers scraping wall and window: <em>creak</em>, <em>creak</em>, <em>creak</em>. He wondered if there were willow-trees close to the house; and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in&#13;
         an ordinary house at all, but inside the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again. He&#13;
         sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and he lay down again relieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words&#13;
         in his ears: ‘Fear nothing! Have peace until the morning! Heed no nightly noises!’ Then he went to sleep again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was the sound of water that Merry heard falling into his quiet sleep: water streaming down gently, and then spreading,&#13;
         spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled under the walls, and was rising slowly but&#13;
         surely. ‘I shall be drowned!’ he thought. ‘It will find its way in, and then I shall drown.’ He felt that he was lying in&#13;
         a soft slimy bog, and springing up he set his foot on the corner of a cold hard flagstone. Then he remembered where he was&#13;
         and lay down again. He seemed to hear or remember hearing: ‘Nothing passes doors or windows save moonlight and starlight and&#13;
         the wind off the hill-top.’ A little breath of sweet air moved the curtain. He breathed deep and fell asleep again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As far as he could remember, Sam slept through the night in deep content, if logs are contented.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They woke up, all four at once, in the morning light. Tom was moving about the room whistling like a starling. When he heard&#13;
         them stir he clapped his hands, and cried: ‘Hey! Come merry dol! derry dol! My hearties!’ He drew back the yellow curtains,&#13;
         and the hobbits saw that these had covered the windows, at either end of the room, one looking east and the other looking&#13;
         west.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They leapt up refreshed. Frodo ran to the eastern window, and found himself looking into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He&#13;
         had half expected to see turf right up to the walls, &#13;
         <a id="page168"/>turf all pocked with hoof-prints. Actually his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles; but above and far beyond&#13;
         them the grey top of the hill loomed up against the sunrise. It was a pale morning: in the East, behind long clouds like lines&#13;
         of soiled wool stained red at the edges, lay glimmering deeps of yellow. The sky spoke of rain to come; but the light was&#13;
         broadening quickly, and the red flowers on the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin looked out of the western window, down into a pool of mist. The Forest was hidden under a fog. It was like looking&#13;
         down on to a sloping cloud-roof from above. There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and billows:&#13;
         the valley of the Withywindle. The stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the white shadows. Near at hand&#13;
         was a flower-garden and a clipped hedge silver-netted, and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew-drops. There was no&#13;
         willow-tree to be seen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening the eastern window wide. A cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell. ‘Sun&#13;
         won’t show her face much today, I’m thinking. I have been walking wide, leaping on the hill-tops, since the grey dawn began,&#13;
         nosing wind and weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky above me. I wakened Goldberry singing under window; but naught wakes&#13;
         hobbit-folk in the early morning. In the night little folk wake up in the darkness, and sleep after light has come! Ring a&#13;
         ding dillo! Wake now, my merry friends! Forget the nightly noises! Ring a ding dillo del! derry del, my hearties! If you come&#13;
         soon you’ll find breakfast on the table. If you come late you’ll get grass and rain-water!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Needless to say – not that Tom’s threat sounded very serious – the hobbits came soon, and left the table late and only when&#13;
         it was beginning to look rather empty. Neither Tom nor Goldberry were there. Tom could be heard about the house, clattering&#13;
         in the kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and singing here and there outside. The room looked &#13;
         <a id="page169"/>westward over the mist-clouded valley, and the window was open. Water dripped down from the thatched eaves above. Before they&#13;
         had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down.&#13;
         Behind its deep curtain the Forest was completely veiled.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was flowing down the rain out of the sky, the clear voice&#13;
         of Goldberry singing up above them. They could hear few words, but it seemed plain to them that the song was a rain-song,&#13;
         as sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the tale of a river from the spring in the highlands to the Sea far below. The&#13;
         hobbits listened with delight; and Frodo was glad in his heart, and blessed the kindly weather, because it delayed them from&#13;
         departing. The thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke; but he guessed now that they would not go&#13;
         further that day.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The upper wind settled in the West and deeper and wetter clouds rolled up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the&#13;
         Downs. Nothing could be seen all round the house but falling water. Frodo stood near the open door and watched the white chalky&#13;
         path turn into a little river of milk and go bubbling away down into the valley. Tom Bombadil came trotting round the corner&#13;
         of the house, waving his arms as if he was warding off the rain – and indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite&#13;
         dry, except for his boots. These he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then he sat in the largest chair and called the&#13;
         hobbits to gather round him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘This is Goldberry’s washing day,’ he said, ‘and her autumn-cleaning. Too wet for hobbit-folk – let them rest while they are&#13;
         able! It’s a good day for long tales, for questions and for answers, so Tom will start the talking.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He then told them many remarkable stories, sometimes half as if speaking to himself, sometimes looking at them suddenly with&#13;
         a bright blue eye under his deep brows. Often &#13;
         <a id="page170"/>his voice would turn to song, and he would get out of his chair and dance about. He told them tales of bees and flowers, the&#13;
         ways of trees, and the strange creatures of the Forest, about the evil things and good things, things friendly and things&#13;
         unfriendly, cruel things and kind things, and secrets hidden under brambles.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As they listened, they began to understand the lives of the Forest, apart from themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the&#13;
         strangers where all other things were at home. Moving constantly in and out of his talk was Old Man Willow, and Frodo learned&#13;
         now enough to content him, indeed more than enough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid bare the hearts of trees&#13;
         and their thoughts, which were often dark and strange, and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon the earth, gnawing,&#13;
         biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers and usurpers. It was not called the Old Forest without reason, for it was indeed&#13;
         ancient, a survivor of vast forgotten woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker than the hills, the fathers of the&#13;
         fathers of trees, remembering times when they were lords. The countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom,&#13;
         and with malice. But none were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart was rotten, but his strength was green; and&#13;
         he was cunning, and a master of winds, and his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the river. His grey&#13;
         thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine root-threads in the ground, and invisible twig-fingers in&#13;
         the air, till it had under its dominion nearly all the trees of the Forest from the Hedge to the Downs.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly Tom’s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream, over bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks,&#13;
         and among small flowers in close grass and wet crannies, wandering at last up on to the Downs. They heard of the Great Barrows,&#13;
         and the green mounds, and the stone-rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills. Sheep were bleating in flocks.&#13;
         Green walls and white walls rose. There were fortresses on the heights. Kings of little kingdoms &#13;
         <a id="page171"/>fought together, and the young Sun shone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords. There was victory and&#13;
         defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and flames went up into the sky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings&#13;
         and queens; and mounds covered them, and the stone doors were shut; and the grass grew over all. Sheep walked for a while&#13;
         biting the grass, but soon the hills were empty again. A shadow came out of dark places far away, and the bones were stirred&#13;
         in the mounds. Barrow-wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers, and gold chains in the wind.&#13;
         Stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumour of the Barrow-wights of the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest had been heard.&#13;
         But it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to, even by a comfortable fireside far away. These four now suddenly&#13;
         remembered what the joy of this house had driven from their minds: the house of Tom Bombadil nestled under the very shoulder&#13;
         of those dreaded hills. They lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one another.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered into strange regions beyond their memory and beyond their&#13;
         waking thought, into times when the world was wider, and the seas flowed straight to the western Shore; and still on and back&#13;
         Tom went singing out into ancient starlight, when only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he stopped, and they saw that&#13;
         he nodded as if he was falling asleep. The hobbits sat still before him, enchanted; and it seemed as if, under the spell of&#13;
         his words, the wind had gone, and the clouds had dried up, and the day had been withdrawn, and darkness had come from East&#13;
         and West, and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Whether the morning and evening of one day or of many days had passed Frodo could not tell. He did not feel either hungry&#13;
         or tired, only filled with wonder. The stars shone through the window and the silence of the heavens seemed &#13;
         <a id="page172"/>to be round him. He spoke at last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who are you, Master?’ he asked.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Eh, what?’ said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom. ‘Don’t you know my name yet? That’s the only answer.&#13;
         Tell me, who are you, alone, yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that’s what I am. Mark my words,&#13;
         my friends: Tom was here before the river and the trees; Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He made paths&#13;
         before the Big People, and saw the little People arriving. He was here before the Kings and the graves and the Barrow-wights.&#13;
         When the Elves passed westward, Tom was here already, before the seas were bent. He knew the dark under the stars when it&#13;
         was fearless – before the Dark Lord came from Outside.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>A shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced hastily through the panes. When they turned again, Goldberry&#13;
         stood in the door behind, framed in light. She held a candle, shielding its flame from the draught with her hand; and the&#13;
         light flowed through it, like sunlight through a white shell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The rain has ended,’ she said; ‘and new waters are running downhill, under the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘And let us have food and drink!’ cried Tom. ‘Long tales are thirsty. And long listening’s hungry work, morning, noon, and&#13;
         evening!’ With that he jumped out of his chair, and with a bound took a candle from the chimney-shelf and lit it in the flame&#13;
         that Goldberry held; then he danced about the table. Suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Quickly he returned, bearing a large and laden tray. Then Tom and Goldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in wonder&#13;
         and half in laughter: so fair was the grace of Goldberry and so merry and odd the caperings of Tom. Yet in some fashion they&#13;
         seemed to weave a single dance, neither hindering the other, in and out of the room, and round about the table; and with great&#13;
         speed food and vessels and lights &#13;
         <a id="page173"/>were set in order. The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow. Tom bowed to his guests. ‘Supper is ready,’ said Goldberry;&#13;
         and now the hobbits saw that she was clothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes’ mail. But&#13;
         Tom was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and he had green stockings.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of Tom’s words may have missed one meal or many, but&#13;
         when the food was before them it seemed at least a week since they had eaten. They did not sing or even speak much for a while,&#13;
         and paid close attention to business. But after a time their hearts and spirits rose high again, and their voices rang out&#13;
         in mirth and laughter.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After they had eaten, Goldberry sang many songs for them, songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into&#13;
         silence; and in the silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had known, and looking into them&#13;
         they saw the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depths. Then once more she wished them each good night and left&#13;
         them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and indeed to know much of all the history and doings&#13;
         of the Shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobbits themselves. It no longer surprised them; but he made no secret&#13;
         that he owed his recent knowledge largely to Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a person of more importance than they&#13;
         had imagined. ‘There’s earth under his old feet, and clay on his fingers; wisdom in his bones, and both his eyes are open,’&#13;
         said Tom. It was also clear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed that in some fashion, news had reached him&#13;
         from Gildor concerning the flight of Frodo.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Indeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his questioning, that Frodo found himself telling him more about Bilbo and&#13;
         his own hopes and fears than he had told before &#13;
         <a id="page174"/>even to Gandalf. Tom wagged his head up and down, and there was a glint in his eyes when he heard of the Riders.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Show me the precious Ring!’ he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and Frodo, to his own astonishment, drew out the&#13;
         chain from his pocket, and unfastening the Ring handed it at once to Tom.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brown-skinned hand. Then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed.&#13;
         For a second the hobbits had a vision, both comical and alarming, of his bright blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold.&#13;
         Then Tom put the Ring round the end of his little finger and held it up to the candlelight. For a moment the hobbits noticed&#13;
         nothing strange about this. Then they gasped. There was no sign of Tom disappearing!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Tom laughed again, and then he spun the Ring in the air – and it vanished with a flash. Frodo gave a cry – and Tom leaned&#13;
         forward and handed it back to him with a smile.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like one who has lent a trinket to a juggler). It was the same Ring,&#13;
         or looked the same and weighed the same: for that Ring had always seemed to Frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand. But&#13;
         something prompted him to make sure. He was perhaps a trifle annoyed with Tom for seeming to make so light of what even Gandalf&#13;
         thought so perilously important. He waited for an opportunity, when the talk was going again, and Tom was telling an absurd&#13;
         story about badgers and their queer ways – then he slipped the Ring on.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Merry turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked an exclamation. Frodo was delighted (in a way): it&#13;
         was his own ring all right, for Merry was staring blankly at his chair, and obviously could not see him. He got up and crept&#13;
         quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hey there!’ cried Tom, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his shining eyes. ‘Hey! Come Frodo, there! Where be&#13;
         you a-going? Old Tom Bombadil’s not as blind as that yet. Take off your golden ring! Your hand’s more fair &#13;
         <a id="page175"/>without it. Come back! Leave your game and sit down beside me! We must talk a while more, and think about the morning. Tom&#13;
         must teach the right road, and keep your feet from wandering.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the Ring he came and sat down again. Tom now told them that he reckoned&#13;
         the Sun would shine tomorrow, and it would be a glad morning, and setting out would be hopeful. But they would do well to&#13;
         start early; for weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change sometimes&#13;
         quicker than he could change his jacket. ‘I am no weather-master,’ said he; ‘nor is aught that goes on two legs.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>By his advice they decided to make nearly due North from his house, over the western and lower slopes of the Downs: they might&#13;
         hope in that way to strike the East Road in a day’s journey, and avoid the Barrows. He told them not to be afraid – but to&#13;
         mind their own business.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Keep to the green grass. Don’t you go a-meddling with old stone or cold Wights or prying in their houses, unless you be strong&#13;
         folk with hearts that never falter!’ He said this more than once; and he advised them to pass barrows by on the west-side,&#13;
         if they chanced to stray near one. Then he taught them a rhyme to sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger or&#13;
         difficulty the next day.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>When they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each on the shoulder with a laugh, and taking candles led them&#13;
         back to their bedroom.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-8">FOG ON THE BARROW-DOWNS</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">That night they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out of them, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing&#13;
         running in his mind: a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn&#13;
         the veil all to glass and silver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him under a swift&#13;
         sunrise.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling like a tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down&#13;
         the hill and through the open window. Outside everything was green and pale gold.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to say farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on&#13;
         such a morning: cool, bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue. The air came fresh from the Northwest. Their&#13;
         quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing and moving restlessly. Tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced upon&#13;
         the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and went slanting up towards the north end of the hill-brow&#13;
         under which it sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Goldberry!’ he cried. ‘My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the&#13;
         evening!’ He was so distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came rippling down. There on the hill-brow&#13;
         she stood beckoning to them: her hair was flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered. A &#13;
         <a id="page177"/>light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she danced.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look&#13;
         round; and they looked out from the hill-top over lands under the morning. It was now as clear and far-seen as it had been&#13;
         veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in the Forest, which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark&#13;
         trees in the West. In that direction the land rose in wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet under the sun, beyond which lay&#13;
         hidden the valley of the Brandywine. To the South, over the line of the Withywindle, there was a distant glint like pale glass&#13;
         where the Brandywine River made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits. Northward&#13;
         beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and swellings of grey and green and pale earth-colours, until it faded&#13;
         into a featureless and shadowy distance. Eastward the Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge into the morning, and vanished&#13;
         out of eyesight into a guess: it was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the hem of the&#13;
         sky, but it spoke to them, out of memory and old tales, of the high and distant mountains.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It&#13;
         seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road, when they should be leaping,&#13;
         as lusty as Tom, over the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the Mountains.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts. ‘Speed now, fair guests!’ she said. ‘And hold to your purpose!&#13;
         North with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the Sun shines!’ And to Frodo she said:&#13;
         ‘Farewell, Elf-friend, it was a merry meeting!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony, and followed by his friends jogged slowly &#13;
         <a id="page178"/>down the gentle slope behind the hill. Tom Bombadil’s house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view. The air grew&#13;
         warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside, and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning&#13;
         back, when they reached the bottom of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small and slender like a sunlit flower against&#13;
         the sky: she was standing still watching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked she gave a clear&#13;
         call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley,&#13;
         and then over the shoulders of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops&#13;
         and down into new valleys. There was no tree nor any visible water: it was a country of grass and short springy turf, silent&#13;
         except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land, and high lonely cries of strange birds. As they journeyed the&#13;
         sun mounted, and grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less. When they caught a glimpse&#13;
         of the country westward the distant Forest seemed to be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf and&#13;
         root and mould. A shadow now lay round the edge of sight, a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and&#13;
         heavy.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>About mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened, like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside&#13;
         there was no air stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode across and looked northwards. Then their hearts&#13;
         rose; for it seemed plain that they had come further already than they had expected. Certainly the distances had now all become&#13;
         hazy and deceptive, but there could be no doubt that the Downs were coming to an end. A long valley lay below them winding&#13;
         away northwards, until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there seemed to be no more hills. Due north&#13;
         they faintly &#13;
         <a id="page179"/>glimpsed a long dark line. ‘That is a line of trees,’ said Merry, ‘and that must mark the Road. All along it for many leagues&#13;
         east of the Bridge there are trees growing. Some say they were planted in the old days.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Splendid!’ said Frodo. ‘If we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning, we shall have left the Downs&#13;
         before the Sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place.’ But even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards,&#13;
         and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and looked down upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green&#13;
         mounds, and on some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and went down into the hollow circle. In the midst of it&#13;
         there stood a single stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hour casting no shadow. It was shapeless and yet&#13;
         significant: like a landmark, or a guarding finger, or more like a warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun was still&#13;
         at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of the stone. It was cool, as if the sun had had no power&#13;
         to warm it; but at that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and drink, and made as good a noon-meal under the&#13;
         open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came from ‘down under Hill’. Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort&#13;
         of the day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the scent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out&#13;
         their legs and looking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough to explain what happened. However that&#13;
         may be: they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take. The standing stone was cold, and it&#13;
         cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them. The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming through the mist&#13;
         just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east, beyond the &#13;
         <a id="page180"/>wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy and chill. Their ponies were standing crowded together with&#13;
         their heads down.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western rim. They found that they were upon an island in the fog.&#13;
         Even as they looked out in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before their eyes into a white sea, and a cold grey shadow&#13;
         sprang up in the East behind. The fog rolled up to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads&#13;
         until it became a roof: they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite lose heart. They still remembered the hopeful view they&#13;
         had had of the line of the Road ahead, and they still knew in which direction it lay. In any case, they now had so great a&#13;
         dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there was in their minds. They packed up as quickly&#13;
         as their chilled fingers would work.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and down the long northward slope of the hill, down into a&#13;
         foggy sea. As they went down the mist became colder and damper, and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads.&#13;
         When they reached the bottom it was so chill that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods, which soon became bedewed with&#13;
         grey drops. Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly on again, feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground.&#13;
         They were steering, as well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end of the long valley which&#13;
         they had seen in the morning. Once they were through the gap, they had only to keep on in anything like a straight line and&#13;
         they were bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps&#13;
         away beyond the Downs there might be no fog.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions they went in file, &#13;
         <a id="page181"/>with Frodo leading. Sam was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry. The valley seemed to stretch on endlessly.&#13;
         Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign. On either side ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they&#13;
         were at last approaching the gap in the hills, the north-gate of the Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be&#13;
         free.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come on! Follow me!’ he called back over his shoulder, and he hurried forward. But his hope soon changed to bewilderment&#13;
         and alarm. The dark patches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous before him and leaning slightly&#13;
         towards one another like the pillars of a headless door, two huge standing stones. He could not remember having seen any sign&#13;
         of these in the valley, when he looked out from the hill in the morning. He had passed between them almost before he was aware:&#13;
         and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him. His pony reared and snorted, and he fell off. When he looked back&#13;
         he found that he was alone: the others had not followed him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Sam!’ he called. ‘Pippin! Merry! Come along! Why don’t you keep up?’</p>&#13;
      <p>There was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past the stones shouting wildly: ‘Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!’ The pony bolted&#13;
         into the mist and vanished. From some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry: ‘Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!’ It was away&#13;
         eastward, on his left as he stood under the great stones, staring and straining into the gloom. He plunged off in the direction&#13;
         of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and more frantically; but he heard no answer for some time, and&#13;
         then it seemed faint and far ahead and high above him. ‘Frodo! Hoy!’ came the thin voices out of the mist: and then a cry&#13;
         that sounded like <em>help</em>, <em>help!</em> often repeated, ending with a last <em>help!</em> that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut short. He stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries;&#13;
         but the light was now gone, and clinging &#13;
         <a id="page182"/>night had closed about him, so that it was impossible to be sure of any direction. He seemed all the time to be climbing up&#13;
         and up.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he at last came to the top of a ridge or hill. He was&#13;
         weary, sweating and yet chilled. It was wholly dark.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where are you?’ he cried out miserably.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">There was no reply. He stood listening. He was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning&#13;
         to blow, an icy wind. A change was coming in the weather. The mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters. His breath&#13;
         was smoking, and the darkness was less near and thick. He looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars were appearing&#13;
         overhead amid the strands of hurrying cloud and fog. The wind began to hiss over the grass.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled&#13;
         up and thrust aside, and the starry sky was unveiled. A glance showed him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round&#13;
         hill-top, which he must have climbed from the north. Out of the east the biting wind was blowing. To his right there loomed&#13;
         against the westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood there.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where are you?’ he cried again, both angry and afraid.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here!’ said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of the ground. ‘I am waiting for you!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No!’ said Frodo; but he did not run away. His knees gave, and he fell on the ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound.&#13;
         Trembling he looked up, in time to see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars. It leaned over him. He thought&#13;
         there were two eyes, very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance. Then a grip stronger&#13;
         and colder than iron seized him. The icy touch froze his bones, and he remembered no more.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page183"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense of dread. Then suddenly he knew that he&#13;
         was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow. A Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under the&#13;
         dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered tales spoke. He dared not move, but lay as he found himself: flat&#13;
         on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkness that was round him, he found himself as he&#13;
         lay thinking about Bilbo Baggins and his stories, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the Shire and talking about&#13;
         roads and adventures. There is a seed of courage hidden (often deeply, it is true) in the heart of the fattest and most timid&#13;
         hobbit, waiting for some final and desperate danger to make it grow. Frodo was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed, though&#13;
         he did not know it, Bilbo (and Gandalf ) had thought him the best hobbit in the Shire. He thought he had come to the end of&#13;
         his adventure, and a terrible end, but the thought hardened him. He found himself stiffening, as if for a final spring; he&#13;
         no longer felt limp like a helpless prey.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all at once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a&#13;
         pale greenish light was growing round him. It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in, for the light seemed&#13;
         to be coming out of himself, and from the floor beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He turned, and there&#13;
         in the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were on their backs, and their faces looked deathly&#13;
         pale; and they were clad in white. About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light they looked cold and&#13;
         unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains were about their waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords&#13;
         lay by their sides, and shields were at their feet. But across their three necks lay one long naked sword.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page184"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. The voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high&#13;
         in the air and thin, sometimes like a low moan from the ground. Out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds, strings&#13;
         of words would now and again shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless and miserable. The night was railing against&#13;
         the morning of which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungered. Frodo was chilled to the&#13;
         marrow. After a while the song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an incantation:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Cold be hand and heart and bone,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>and cold be sleep under stone:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>never more to wake on stony bed,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>In the black wind the stars shall die,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em> and still on gold here let them lie,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>till the dark lord lifts his hand</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>over dead sea and withered land.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising himself on one arm he looked, and saw now in the pale light&#13;
         that they were in a kind of passage which behind them turned a corner. Round the corner a long arm was groping, walking on&#13;
         its fingers towards Sam, who was lying nearest, and towards the hilt of the sword that lay upon him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At first Frodo felt as if he had indeed been turned into stone by the incantation. Then a wild thought of escape came to him.&#13;
         He wondered if he put on the Ring, whether the Barrow-wight would miss him, and he might find some way out. He thought of&#13;
         himself running free over the grass, grieving for Merry, and Sam, and Pippin, but free and alive himself. Gandalf would admit&#13;
         that there had been nothing else he could do.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he could not leave his friends so easily. He &#13;
         <a id="page185"/>wavered, groping in his pocket, and then fought with himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve&#13;
         hardened in him, and he seized a short sword that lay beside him, and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions.&#13;
         With what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and the hand broke off; but at the same moment the&#13;
         sword splintered up to the hilt. There was a shriek and the light vanished. In the dark there was a snarling noise.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo fell forward over Merry, and Merry’s face felt cold. All at once back into his mind, from which it had disappeared with&#13;
         the first coming of the fog, came the memory of the house down under the Hill, and of Tom singing. He remembered the rhyme&#13;
         that Tom had taught them. In a small desperate voice he began: <em>Ho! Tom Bombadil!</em> and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong: it had a full and lively sound, and the dark chamber echoed as if to&#13;
         drum and trumpet.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Come, Tom Bombadil, for our need is near us!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>There was a sudden deep silence, in which Frodo could hear his heart beating. After a long slow moment he heard plain, but&#13;
         far away, as if it was coming down through the ground or through thick walls, an answering voice singing:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the master:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>There was a loud rumbling sound, as of stones rolling and falling, and suddenly light streamed in, real light, the plain light&#13;
         of day. A low door-like opening appeared at the end of &#13;
         <a id="page186"/>the chamber beyond Frodo’s feet; and there was Tom’s head (hat, feather, and all) framed against the light of the sun rising&#13;
         red behind him. The light fell upon the floor, and upon the faces of the three hobbits lying beside Frodo. They did not stir,&#13;
         but the sickly hue had left them. They looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Tom stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing:</p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash. Then there was a long trailing&#13;
         shriek, fading away into an unguessable distance; and after that silence.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come, friend Frodo!’ said Tom. ‘Let us get out on to clean grass! You must help me bear them.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Together they carried out Merry, Pippin, and Sam. As Frodo left the barrow for the last time he thought he saw a severed hand&#13;
         wriggling still, like a wounded spider, in a heap of fallen earth. Tom went back in again, and there was a sound of much thumping&#13;
         and stamping. When he came out he was bearing in his arms a great load of treasure: things of gold, silver, copper, and bronze;&#13;
         many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments. He climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair, and looked down upon the three hobbits, that had been laid&#13;
         on their backs upon the grass at the west side of the mound. Raising his right hand he said in a clear and commanding voice:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page187"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Wake now my merry lads! Wake and hear me calling!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Warm now be heart and limb! The cold stone is fallen;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Night under Night is flown, and the Gate is open!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>To Frodo’s great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed their eyes, and then suddenly sprang up. They looked&#13;
         about in amazement, first at Frodo, and then at Tom standing large as life on the barrow-top above them; and then at themselves&#13;
         in their thin white rags, crowned and belted with pale gold, and jingling with trinkets.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What in the name of wonder?’ began Merry, feeling the golden circlet that had slipped over one eye. Then he stopped, and&#13;
         a shadow came over his face, and he closed his eyes. ‘Of course, I remember!’ he said. ‘The men of Carn Dûm came on us at&#13;
         night, and we were worsted. Ah! the spear in my heart!’ He clutched at his breast. ‘No! No!’ he said, opening his eyes. ‘What&#13;
         am I saying? I have been dreaming. Where did you get to, Frodo?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I thought that I was lost,’ said Frodo; ‘but I don’t want to speak of it. Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go&#13;
         on!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Dressed up like this, sir?’ said Sam. ‘Where are my clothes?’ He flung his circlet, belt, and rings on the grass, and looked&#13;
         round helplessly, as if he expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches, and other hobbit-garments lying somewhere to&#13;
         hand.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You won’t find your clothes again,’ said Tom, bounding down from the mound, and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight.&#13;
         One would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened; and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts as&#13;
         they looked at him, and saw the merry glint in his eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you mean?’ asked Pippin, looking at him, half puzzled and half amused. ‘Why not?’</p>&#13;
      <p>But Tom shook his head, saying: ‘You’ve found yourselves again, out of the deep water. Clothes are but little loss, &#13;
         <a id="page188"/>if you escape from drowning. Be glad, my merry friends, and let the warm sunlight heat now heart and limb! Cast off these&#13;
         cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while Tom goes a-hunting!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. Looking down after him Frodo saw him running away southwards along the green&#13;
         hollow between their hill and the next, still whistling and crying:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Hey! now! Come hoy now! Whither do you wander?</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Sharp-ears, Wise-nose, Swish-tail and Bumpkin,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>White-socks my little lad, and old Fatty Lumpkin!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until he was hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time&#13;
         his <em>hey now! hoy now!</em> came floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while on the grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking&#13;
         in the sun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a friendly clime, or of people that,&#13;
         after being long ill and bedridden, wake one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill,&#13;
         and behind him came in an obedient line <em>six</em> ponies: their own five and one more. The last was plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (and older)&#13;
         than their own ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them any such names, but they answered&#13;
         to the new names that Tom had given them for the rest of their lives. Tom called them one by one and they climbed over the&#13;
         brow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page189"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Here are your ponies, now!’ he said. ‘They’ve more sense (in some ways) than you wandering hobbits have – more sense in their&#13;
         noses. For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if they run to save themselves, then they run the right&#13;
         way. You must forgive them all; for though their hearts are faithful, to face fear of Barrow-wights is not what they were&#13;
         made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Merry, Sam, and Pippin now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs; and they soon felt too hot, for they were&#13;
         obliged to put on some of the thicker and warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winter.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where does that other old animal, that Fatty Lumpkin, come from?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘He’s mine,’ said Tom. ‘My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides.&#13;
         When your ponies stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they smelt him in the night, and quickly ran to meet him.&#13;
         I thought he’d look for them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old Tom’s going&#13;
         to ride. Hey! he’s coming with you, just to set you on the road; so he needs a pony. For you cannot easily talk to hobbits&#13;
         that are riding, when you’re on your own legs trying to trot beside them.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom many times; but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing&#13;
         themselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land. ‘I’ve got things to do,’&#13;
         he said: ‘my making and my singing, my talking and my walking, and my watching of the country. Tom can’t be always near to&#13;
         open doors and willow-cracks. Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">It was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and ten, and the hobbits turned their minds to food. Their last&#13;
         meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before. They breakfasted now off the remainder of Tom’s &#13;
         <a id="page190"/>provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that Tom had brought with him. It was not a large meal (considering hobbits&#13;
         and the circumstances), but they felt much better for it. While they were eating Tom went up to the mound, and looked through&#13;
         the treasures. Most of these he made into a pile that glistered and sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie there ‘free to&#13;
         all finders, birds, beasts, Elves or Men, and all kindly creatures’; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered&#13;
         and no Wight ever come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers&#13;
         or the wings of blue butterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his head, and saying at last:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here is a pretty toy for Tom and for his lady! Fair was she who long ago wore this on her shoulder. Goldberry shall wear&#13;
         it now, and we will not forget her!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms&#13;
         in red and gold. They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange metal, light and strong, and&#13;
         set with many fiery stones. Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the blades&#13;
         seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,’ he said. ‘Sharp blades are good to have, if Shire-folk go walking,&#13;
         east, south, or far away into dark and danger.’ Then he told them that these blades were forged many long years ago by Men&#13;
         of Westernesse: they were foes of the Dark Lord, but they were overcome by the evil king of Carn Dûm in the Land of Angmar.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Few now remember them,’ Tom murmured, ‘yet still some go wandering, sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness, guarding&#13;
         from evil things folk that are heedless.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind&#13;
         them, like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode &#13;
         <a id="page191"/>shapes of Men, tall and grim with bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow. Then the vision faded, and they&#13;
         were back in the sunlit world. It was time to start again. They made ready, packing their bags and lading their ponies. Their&#13;
         new weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them very awkward, and wondering if they would be&#13;
         of any use. Fighting had not before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and then mounting they trotted quickly along the valley. They looked&#13;
         back and saw the top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flame. Then&#13;
         they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it was hidden from view.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great stones standing like a gate, and before long they&#13;
         came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them. It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil&#13;
         trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang&#13;
         most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language&#13;
         whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further away than they had imagined. Even without a fog, their&#13;
         sleep at mid-day would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day before. The dark line they had&#13;
         seen was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side.&#13;
         Tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom, but a very long time ago. He seemed to remember something sad about&#13;
         it, and would not say much.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall, and then Tom turned due north, for they had &#13;
         <a id="page192"/>been bearing somewhat to the west. The land was now open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace, but the sun was&#13;
         already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead, and they knew that they had come back to the Road after&#13;
         many unexpected adventures. They galloped their ponies over the last furlongs, and halted under the long shadows of the trees.&#13;
         They were on the top of a sloping bank, and the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away below them. At this point it&#13;
         ran nearly from South-west to North-east, and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore&#13;
         many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes full of water.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They rode down the bank and looked up and down. There was nothing to be seen. ‘Well, here we are again at last!’ said Frodo.&#13;
         ‘I suppose we haven’t lost more than two days by my short cut through the Forest! But perhaps the delay will prove useful&#13;
         – it may have put them off our trail.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The others looked at him. The shadow of the fear of the Black Riders came suddenly over them again. Ever since they had entered&#13;
         the Forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the Road; only now when it lay beneath their feet did they remember&#13;
         the danger which pursued them, and was more than likely to be lying in wait for them upon the Road itself. They looked anxiously&#13;
         back towards the setting sun, but the Road was brown and empty.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do you think,’ asked Pippin hesitatingly, ‘do you think we may be pursued, tonight?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, I hope not tonight,’ answered Tom Bombadil; ‘nor perhaps the next day. But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for&#13;
         certain. Out east my knowledge fails. Tom is not master of Riders from the Black Land far beyond his country.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. They felt that he would know how to deal with Black Riders, if anyone&#13;
         did. They would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them, and beyond all but the most vague and distant&#13;
         legends of the Shire, and in the gathering &#13;
         <a id="page193"/>twilight they longed for home. A deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them. They stood silent, reluctant to make the final&#13;
         parting, and only slowly became aware that Tom was wishing them farewell, and telling them to have good heart and to ride&#13;
         on till dark without halting.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Tom will give you good advice, till this day is over (after that your own luck must go with you and guide you): four miles&#13;
         along the Road you’ll come upon a village, Bree under Bree-hill, with doors looking westward. There you’ll find an old inn&#13;
         that is called <em>The Prancing Pony</em>. Barliman Butterbur is the worthy keeper. There you can stay the night, and afterwards the morning will speed you upon your&#13;
         way. Be bold, but wary! Keep up your merry hearts, and ride to meet your fortune!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more with them; but he laughed and refused, saying:</p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Tom’s country ends here: he will not pass the borders.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on Lumpkin’s back, and rode up over the bank and away singing into the dusk.</p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am sorry to take leave of Master Bombadil,’ said Sam. ‘He’s a caution and no mistake. I reckon we may go a good deal further&#13;
         and see naught better, nor queerer. But I won’t deny I’ll be glad to see this <em>Prancing Pony</em> he spoke of. I hope it’ll be like <em>The Green Dragon</em> away back home! What sort of folk are they in Bree?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There are hobbits in Bree,’ said Merry, ‘as well as Big Folk. I daresay it will be homelike enough. <em>The Pony</em> is a good inn by all accounts. My people ride out there now and again.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It may be all we could wish,’ said Frodo; ‘but it is outside the Shire all the same. Don’t make yourselves too much at &#13;
         <a id="page194"/>home! Please remember – all of you – that the name of Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must&#13;
         be given.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the evening. Darkness came down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill&#13;
         and up again, until at last they saw lights twinkling some distance ahead.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Before them rose Bree-hill barring the way, a dark mass against misty stars; and under its western flank nestled a large village.&#13;
         Towards it they now hurried desiring only to find a fire, and a door between them and the night.&#13;

            <em>Chapter</em> 9</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-9">AT THE SIGN OF THE PRANCING PONY</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">Bree was the chief village of the Bree-land, a small inhabited region, like an island in the empty lands round about. Besides&#13;
         Bree itself, there was Staddle on the other side of the hill, Combe in a deep valley a little further eastward, and Archet&#13;
         on the edge of the Chetwood. Lying round Bree-hill and the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland only&#13;
         a few miles broad.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Men of Bree were brown-haired, broad, and rather short, cheerful and independent: they belonged to nobody but themselves;&#13;
         but they were more friendly and familiar with Hobbits, Dwarves, Elves, and other inhabitants of the world about them than&#13;
         was (or is) usual with Big People. According to their own tales they were the original inhabitants and were the descendants&#13;
         of the first Men that ever wandered into the West of the middle-world. Few had survived the turmoils of the Elder Days; but&#13;
         when the Kings returned again over the Great Sea they had found the Bree-men still there, and they were still there now, when&#13;
         the memory of the old Kings had faded into the grass.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In those days no other Men had settled dwellings so far west, or within a hundred leagues of the Shire. But in the wild lands&#13;
         beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers. The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing of their origin. They were&#13;
         taller and darker than the Men of Bree and were believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the&#13;
         languages of beasts and birds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards even as far as the Misty Mountains; but they&#13;
         were now few and rarely seen. When they appeared they brought news from afar, and told strange forgotten tales which were&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page196"/>eagerly listened to; but the Bree-folk did not make friends of them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There were also many families of hobbits in the Bree-land; and <em>they</em> claimed to be the oldest settlement of Hobbits in the world, one that was founded long before even the Brandywine was crossed&#13;
         and the Shire colonized. They lived mostly in Staddle though there were some in Bree itself, especially on the higher slopes&#13;
         of the hill, above the houses of the Men. The Big Folk and the Little Folk (as they called one another) were on friendly terms,&#13;
         minding their own affairs in their own ways, but both rightly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the Bree-folk. Nowhere&#13;
         else in the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not themselves travel much; and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concern.&#13;
         Occasionally the Hobbits of Bree went as far as Buckland, or the Eastfarthing; but though their little land was not much further&#13;
         than a day’s riding east of the Brandywine Bridge, the Hobbits of the Shire now seldom visited it. An occasional Bucklander&#13;
         or adventurous Took would come out to the Inn for a night or two, but even that was becoming less and less usual. The Shire-hobbits&#13;
         referred to those of Bree, and to any others that lived beyond the borders, as Outsiders, and took very little interest in&#13;
         them, considering them dull and uncouth. There were probably many more Outsiders scattered about in the West of the World&#13;
         in those days than the people of the Shire imagined. Some, doubtless, were no better than tramps, ready to dig a hole in any&#13;
         bank and stay only as long as it suited them. But in the Bree-land, at any rate, the hobbits were decent and prosperous, and&#13;
         no more rustic than most of their distant relatives Inside. It was not yet forgotten that there had been a time when there&#13;
         was much coming and going between the Shire and Bree. There was Bree-blood in the Brandybucks by all accounts.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The village of Bree had some hundred stone houses of the Big Folk, mostly above the Road, nestling on the hillside with &#13;
         <a id="page197"/>windows looking west. On that side, running in more than half a circle from the hill and back to it, there was a deep dike&#13;
         with a thick hedge on the inner side. Over this the Road crossed by a causeway; but where it pierced the hedge it was barred&#13;
         by a great gate. There was another gate in the southern corner where the Road ran out of the village. The gates were closed&#13;
         at nightfall; but just inside them were small lodges for the gatekeepers.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Down on the Road, where it swept to the right to go round the foot of the hill, there was a large inn. It had been built long&#13;
         ago when the traffic on the roads had been far greater. For Bree stood at an old meeting of ways; another ancient road crossed&#13;
         the East Road just outside the dike at the western end of the village, and in former days Men and other folk of various sorts&#13;
         had travelled much on it. <em>Strange as News from Bree</em> was still a saying in the Eastfarthing, descending from those days, when news from North, South, and East could be heard&#13;
         in the inn, and when the Shire-hobbits used to go more often to hear it. But the Northern Lands had long been desolate, and&#13;
         the North Road was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the Bree-folk called it the Greenway.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Inn of Bree was still there, however, and the innkeeper was an important person. His house was a meeting place for the&#13;
         idle, talkative, and inquisitive among the inhabitants, large and small, of the four villages; and a resort of Rangers and&#13;
         other wanderers, and for such travellers (mostly dwarves) as still journeyed on the East Road, to and from the Mountains.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">It was dark, and white stars were shining, when Frodo and his companions came at last to the Greenway-crossing and drew near&#13;
         the village. They came to the West-gate and found it shut; but at the door of the lodge beyond it, there was a man sitting.&#13;
         He jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at them in surprise.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you want, and where do you come from?’ he asked gruffly.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page198"/>&#13;
      <p>‘We are making for the inn here,’ answered Frodo. ‘We are journeying east and cannot go further tonight.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hobbits! Four hobbits! And what’s more, out of the Shire by their talk,’ said the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself.&#13;
         He stared at them darkly for a moment, and then slowly opened the gate and let them ride through.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We don’t often see Shire-folk riding on the Road at night,’ he went on, as they halted a moment by his door. ‘You’ll pardon&#13;
         my wondering what business takes you away east of Bree! What may your names be, might I ask?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good place to discuss them,’ said Frodo, not liking the&#13;
         look of the man or the tone of his voice.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Your business is your own, no doubt,’ said the man; ‘but it’s my business to ask questions after nightfall.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We are hobbits from Buckland, and we have a fancy to travel and to stay at the inn here,’ put in Merry. ‘I am Mr. Brandybuck.&#13;
         Is that enough for you? The Bree-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers, or so I had heard.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All right, all right!’ said the man. ‘I meant no offence. But you’ll find maybe that more folk than old Harry at the gate&#13;
         will be asking you questions. There’s queer folk about. If you go on to <em>The Pony</em>, you’ll find you’re not the only guests.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He wished them good night, and they said no more; but Frodo could see in the lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them&#13;
         curiously. He was glad to hear the gate clang to behind them, as they rode forward. He wondered why the man was so suspicious,&#13;
         and whether anyone had been asking for news of a party of hobbits. Could it have been Gandalf? He might have arrived, while&#13;
         they were delayed in the Forest and the Downs. But there was something in the look and the voice of the gatekeeper that made&#13;
         him uneasy.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to his house. As soon as his back was turned, a dark&#13;
         figure climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village street.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page199"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, and drew up outside the inn. The houses looked large&#13;
         and strange to them. Sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows, and felt his heart sink. He had imagined&#13;
         himself meeting giants taller than trees, and other creatures even more terrifying, some time or other in the course of his&#13;
         journey; but at the moment he was finding his first sight of Men and their tall houses quite enough, indeed too much for the&#13;
         dark end of a tiring day. He pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the inn-yard, and Black Riders peering&#13;
         out of dark upper windows.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We surely aren’t going to stay here for the night, are we, sir?’ he exclaimed. ‘If there are hobbit-folk in these parts,&#13;
         why don’t we look for some that would be willing to take us in? It would be more homelike.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What’s wrong with the inn?’ said Frodo. ‘Tom Bombadil recommended it. I expect it’s homelike enough inside.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes. It had a front on the Road, and two wings running&#13;
         back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill, so that at the rear the second-floor windows were level with&#13;
         the ground. There was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between the two wings, and on the left under the arch there was a&#13;
         large doorway reached by a few broad steps. The door was open and light streamed out of it. Above the arch there was a lamp,&#13;
         and beneath it swung a large signboard: a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs. Over the door was painted in white letters:&#13;
         the prancing pony by barliman butterbur. Many of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a merry song inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly&#13;
         in the chorus. They listened to this encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their ponies. The song ended and there&#13;
         was a burst of laughter and clapping.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing in the yard they climbed up the steps. Frodo went &#13;
         <a id="page200"/>forward and nearly bumped into a short fat man with a bald head and a red face. He had a white apron on, and was bustling&#13;
         out of one door and in through another, carrying a tray laden with full mugs.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Can we——’ began Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Half a minute, if you please!’ shouted the man over his shoulder, and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke.&#13;
         In a moment he was out again, wiping his hands on his apron.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good evening, little master!’ he said, bending down. ‘What may you be wanting?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Beds for four, and stabling for five ponies, if that can be managed. Are you Mr. Butterbur?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That’s right! Barliman is my name. Barliman Butterbur at your service! You’re from the Shire, eh?’ he said, and then suddenly&#13;
         he clapped his hand to his forehead, as if trying to remember something. ‘Hobbits!’ he cried. ‘Now what does that remind me&#13;
         of? Might I ask your names, sirs?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Mr. Took and Mr. Brandybuck,’ said Frodo; ‘and this is Sam Gamgee. My name is Underhill.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘There now!’ said Mr. Butterbur, snapping his fingers. ‘It’s gone again! But it’ll come back, when I have time to think. I’m&#13;
         run off my feet; but I’ll see what I can do for you. We don’t often get a party out of the Shire nowadays, and I should be&#13;
         sorry not to make you welcome. But there is such a crowd already in the house tonight as there hasn’t been for long enough.&#13;
         It never rains but it pours, we say in Bree.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hi! Nob!’ he shouted. ‘Where are you, you woolly-footed slowcoach? Nob!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Coming, sir! Coming!’ A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door, and seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at&#13;
         them with great interest.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where’s Bob?’ asked the landlord. ‘You don’t know? Well, find him! Double sharp! I haven’t got six legs, nor six eyes neither!&#13;
         Tell Bob there’s five ponies that have to be stabled. He must find room somehow.’ Nob trotted off with a grin and a wink.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page201"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Well now, what was I going to say?’ said Mr. Butterbur, tapping his forehead. ‘One thing drives out another, so to speak.&#13;
         I’m that busy tonight, my head is going round. There’s a party that came up the Greenway from down South last night – and&#13;
         that was strange enough to begin with. Then there’s a travelling company of dwarves going West come in this evening. And now&#13;
         there’s you. If you weren’t hobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But we’ve got a room or two in the north wing that were&#13;
         made special for hobbits, when this place was built. On the ground floor as they usually prefer; round windows and all as&#13;
         they like it. I hope you’ll be comfortable. You’ll be wanting supper, I don’t doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door. ‘Here is a nice little parlour!’ he said. ‘I hope it will suit.&#13;
         Excuse me now. I’m that busy. No time for talking. I must be trotting. It’s hard work for two legs, but I don’t get thinner.&#13;
         I’ll look in again later. If you want anything, ring the hand-bell, and Nob will come. If he don’t come, ring and shout!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed capable of an endless stream of talk, however busy&#13;
         he might be. They found themselves in a small and cosy room. There was a bit of bright fire burning on the hearth, and in&#13;
         front of it were some low and comfortable chairs. There was a round table, already spread with a white cloth, and on it was&#13;
         a large hand-bell. But Nob, the hobbit servant, came bustling in long before they thought of ringing. He brought candles and&#13;
         a tray full of plates.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Will you be wanting anything to drink, masters?’ he asked. ‘And shall I show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?’</p>&#13;
      <p>They were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr. Butterbur and Nob came in again. In a twinkling the&#13;
         table was laid. There was hot soup, cold meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs of butter, and half a ripe cheese: good&#13;
         plain food, as good as the Shire could show, &#13;
         <a id="page202"/>and homelike enough to dispel the last of Sam’s misgivings (already much relieved by the excellence of the beer).&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The landlord hovered round for a little, and then prepared to leave them. ‘I don’t know whether you would care to join the&#13;
         company, when you have supped,’ he said, standing at the door. ‘Perhaps you would rather go to your beds. Still the company&#13;
         would be very pleased to welcome you, if you had a mind. We don’t get Outsiders – travellers from the Shire, I should say,&#13;
         begging your pardon – often; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story or song you may have in mind. But as you please!&#13;
         Ring the bell, if you lack anything!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper (about three quarters of an hour’s steady going, not&#13;
         hindered by unnecessary talk) that Frodo, Pippin, and Sam decided to join the company. Merry said it would be too stuffy.&#13;
         ‘I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit, and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and&#13;
         don’t forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret, and are still on the high-road and not very far from the Shire!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All right!’ said Pippin. ‘Mind yourself! Don’t get lost, and don’t forget that it is safer indoors!’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The company was in the big common-room of the inn. The gathering was large and mixed, as Frodo discovered, when his eyes got&#13;
         used to the light. This came chiefly from a blazing log-fire, for the three lamps hanging from the beams were dim, and half&#13;
         veiled in smoke. Barliman Butterbur was standing near the fire, talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two strange-looking&#13;
         men. On the benches were various folk: men of Bree, a collection of local hobbits (sitting chattering together), a few more&#13;
         dwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows and corners.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As soon as the Shire-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome from the Bree-landers. The strangers, especially those&#13;
         that had come up the Greenway, stared at them &#13;
         <a id="page203"/>curiously. The landlord introduced the newcomers to the Bree-folk, so quickly that, though they caught many names, they were&#13;
         seldom sure who the names belonged to. The Men of Bree seemed all to have rather botanical (and to the Shire-folk rather odd)&#13;
         names, like Rushlight, Goatleaf, Heathertoes, Appledore, Thistlewool and Ferny (not to mention Butterbur). Some of the hobbits&#13;
         had similar names. The Mugworts, for instance, seemed numerous. But most of them had natural names, such as Banks, Brockhouse,&#13;
         Longholes, Sandheaver, and Tunnelly, many of which were used in the Shire. There were several Underhills from Staddle, and&#13;
         as they could not imagine sharing a name without being related, they took Frodo to their hearts as a long-lost cousin.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive, and Frodo soon found that some explanation of what he was doing&#13;
         would have to be given. He gave out that he was interested in history and geography (at which there was much wagging of heads,&#13;
         although neither of these words were much used in the Bree-dialect). He said he was thinking of writing a book (at which there&#13;
         was silent astonishment), and that he and his friends wanted to collect information about hobbits living outside the Shire,&#13;
         especially in the eastern lands.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At this a chorus of voices broke out. If Frodo had really wanted to write a book, and had had many ears, he would have learned&#13;
         enough for several chapters in a few minutes. And if that was not enough, he was given a whole list of names, beginning with&#13;
         ‘Old Barliman here’, to whom he could go for further information. But after a time, as Frodo did not show any sign of writing&#13;
         a book on the spot, the hobbits returned to their questions about doings in the Shire. Frodo did not prove very communicative,&#13;
         and he soon found himself sitting alone in a corner, listening and looking around.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Men and Dwarves were mostly talking of distant events and telling news of a kind that was becoming only too familiar.&#13;
         There was trouble away in the South, and it seemed &#13;
         <a id="page204"/>that the Men who had come up the Greenway were on the move, looking for lands where they could find some peace. The Bree-folk&#13;
         were sympathetic, but plainly not very ready to take a large number of strangers into their little land. One of the travellers,&#13;
         a squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling that more and more people would be coming north in the near future. ‘If&#13;
         room isn’t found for them, they’ll find it for themselves. They’ve a right to live, same as other folk,’ he said loudly. The&#13;
         local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, as it did not at the moment seem to concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly&#13;
         beg for lodgings in hobbit-holes. They were more interested in Sam and Pippin, who were now feeling quite at home, and were&#13;
         chatting gaily about events in the Shire. Pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account of the collapse of the roof&#13;
         of the Town Hole in Michel Delving: Will Whitfoot, the Mayor, and the fattest hobbit in the Westfarthing, had been buried&#13;
         in chalk, and came out like a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked that made Frodo a little uneasy. One&#13;
         of the Bree-landers, who seemed to have been in the Shire several times, wanted to know where the Underhills lived and who&#13;
         they were related to.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-beaten man, sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also listening&#13;
         intently to the hobbit-talk. He had a tall tankard in front of him, and was smoking a long-stemmed pipe curiously carved.&#13;
         His legs were stretched out before him, showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well, but had seen much wear&#13;
         and were now caked with mud. A travel-stained cloak of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the&#13;
         heat of the room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be seen as he watched the hobbits.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who is that?’ Frodo asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr. Butterbur. ‘I don’t think you introduced him?’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page205"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Him?’ said the landlord in an answering whisper, cocking an eye without turning his head. ‘I don’t rightly know. He is one&#13;
         of the wandering folk – Rangers we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare tale when he has the mind.&#13;
         He disappears for a month, or a year, and then he pops up again. He was in and out pretty often last spring; but I haven’t&#13;
         seen him about lately. What his right name is I’ve never heard: but he’s known round here as Strider. Goes about at a great&#13;
         pace on his long shanks; though he don’t tell nobody what cause he has to hurry. But there’s no accounting for East and West,&#13;
         as we say in Bree, meaning the Rangers and the Shire-folk, begging your pardon. Funny you should ask about him.’ But at that&#13;
         moment Mr. Butterbur was called away by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unexplained.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo found that Strider was now looking at him, as if he had heard or guessed all that had been said. Presently, with a wave&#13;
         of his hand and a nod, he invited Frodo to come over and sit by him. As Frodo drew near he threw back his hood, showing a&#13;
         shaggy head of dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of keen grey eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am called Strider,’ he said in a low voice. ‘I am very pleased to meet you, Master – Underhill, if old Butterbur got your&#13;
         name right.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He did,’ said Frodo stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyes.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, Master Underhill,’ said Strider, ‘if I were you, I should stop your young friends from talking too much. Drink, fire,&#13;
         and chance-meeting are pleasant enough, but, well – this isn’t the Shire. There are queer folk about. Though I say it as shouldn’t,&#13;
         you may think,’ he added with a wry smile, seeing Frodo’s glance. ‘And there have been even stranger travellers through Bree&#13;
         lately,’ he went on, watching Frodo’s face.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo returned his gaze but said nothing; and Strider made no further sign. His attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on Pippin.&#13;
         To his alarm Frodo became aware that the ridiculous &#13;
         <a id="page206"/>young Took, encouraged by his success with the fat Mayor of Michel Delving, was now actually giving a comic account of Bilbo’s&#13;
         farewell party. He was already giving an imitation of the Speech, and was drawing near to the astonishing Disappearance.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most of the local hobbits, no doubt: just a funny story about those funny&#13;
         people away beyond the River; but some (old Butterbur, for instance) knew a thing or two, and had probably heard rumours long&#13;
         ago about Bilbo’s vanishing. It would bring the name of Baggins to their minds, especially if there had been inquiries in&#13;
         Bree after that name.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo fidgeted, wondering what to do. Pippin was evidently much enjoying the attention he was getting, and had become quite&#13;
         forgetful of their danger. Frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even mention the Ring; and that might&#13;
         well be disastrous.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You had better do something quick!’ whispered Strider in his ear.</p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. The attention of Pippin’s audience was disturbed. Some of the hobbits&#13;
         looked at Frodo and laughed and clapped, thinking that Mr. Underhill had taken as much ale as was good for him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his habit when making a speech) fingering the things in his pocket.&#13;
         He felt the Ring on its chain, and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly&#13;
         situation. It seemed to him, somehow, as if the suggestion came to him from outside, from someone or something in the room.&#13;
         He resisted the temptation firmly, and clasped the Ring in his hand, as if to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping&#13;
         or doing any mischief. At any rate it gave him no inspiration. He spoke ‘a few suitable words’, as they would have said in&#13;
         the Shire: <em>We are all very much gratified by the kindness of your reception, and I venture to hope that my brief visit will help to renew&#13;
            the old ties of</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page207"/>&#13;
      <p><em>friendship between the Shire and Bree</em>; and then he hesitated and coughed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Everyone in the room was now looking at him. ‘A song!’ shouted one of the hobbits. ‘A song! A song!’ shouted all the others.&#13;
         ‘Come on now, master, sing us something that we haven’t heard before!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>For a moment Frodo stood gaping. Then in desperation he began a ridiculous song that Bilbo had been rather fond of (and indeed&#13;
         rather proud of, for he had made up the words himself ). It was about an inn; and that is probably why it came into Frodo’s&#13;
         mind just then. Here it is in full. Only a few words of it are now, as a rule, remembered.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>There is an inn, a merry old inn</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>beneath an old grey hill,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And there they brew a beer so brown</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>That the Man in the Moon himself came down</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>one night to drink his fill.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>The ostler has a tipsy cat</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>that plays a five-stringed fiddle;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And up and down he runs his bow,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Now squeaking high, now purring low,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>now sawing in the middle.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>The landlord keeps a little dog</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>that is mighty fond of jokes;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>When there’s good cheer among the guests,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>He cocks an ear at all the jests</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>and laughs until he chokes.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>They also keep a hornéd cow</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>as proud as any queen;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>But music turns her head like ale,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And makes her wave her tufted tail</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>and dance upon the green.</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page208"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>And O! the rows of silver dishes</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>and the store of silver spoons!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>For Sunday</em><sup>&#13;

         <a id="footnote_reference_5"/><em>there’s a special pair,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And these they polish up with care</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>on Saturday afternoons.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>The Man in the Moon was drinking deep,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>and the cat began to wail;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>A dish and a spoon on the table danced,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>The cow in the garden madly pranced,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>and the little dog chased his tail.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>The Man in the Moon took another mug</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em> and then rolled beneath his chair;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Till in the sky the stars were pale,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>and dawn was in the air.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>‘The white horses of the Moon,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>They neigh and champ their silver bits;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>But their master’s been and drowned his wits,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>and the Sun’ll be rising soon!’</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>a jig that would wake the dead:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>‘It’s after three!’ he said.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>They rolled the Man slowly up the hill</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>and bundled him into the Moon,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>While his horses galloped up in rear,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And the cow came capering like a deer,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>and a dish ran up with the spoon.</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;</em></p>&#13;
<p class="vex-t"><em>the dog began to roar,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>The cow and the horses stood on their heads;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>The guests all bounded from their beds</em></p>&#13;
 <p class="vext3"><em>and danced upon the floor.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>With a ping and a pong the fiddle-strings broke!</em></p>&#13;
 <p class="vex-t"><em>the cow jumped over the Moon,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And the little dog laughed to see such fun,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And the Saturday dish went off at a run</em></p>&#13;
 <p class="vext3"><em>with the silver Sunday spoon.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>The round Moon rolled behind the hill</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>as the Sun raised up her head.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>She</em><sup>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>For though it was day, to her surprise</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>they all went back to bed!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>There was loud and long applause. Frodo had a good voice, and the song tickled their fancy. ‘Where’s old Barley?’ they cried.&#13;
         ‘He ought to hear this. Bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle, and then we’d have a dance.’ They called for more ale, and&#13;
         began to shout: ‘Let’s have it again, master! Come on now! Once more!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They made Frodo have another drink, and then begin his song again, while many of them joined in; for the tune was well known,&#13;
         and they were quick at picking up words. It was now Frodo’s turn to feel pleased with himself. He capered about on the table;&#13;
         and when he came a second time to <em>the cow jumped over the Moon</em>, he leaped in the air. Much too vigorously; for he came down, bang, into a tray full of mugs, and slipped, and rolled off&#13;
         the table with a crash, clatter, and bump! The audience all opened their mouths wide for laughter, and stopped short in gaping&#13;
         silence; for the singer &#13;
         <a id="page210"/>disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had gone slap through the floor without leaving a hole!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their feet and shouted for Barliman. All the company drew away from&#13;
         Pippin and Sam, who found themselves left alone in a corner, and eyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance. It was plain&#13;
         that many people regarded them now as the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose. But there was&#13;
         one swarthy Bree-lander, who stood looking at them with a knowing and half-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable.&#13;
         Presently he slipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the two had been whispering together a good&#13;
         deal during the evening.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo felt a fool. Not knowing what else to do, he crawled away under the tables to the dark corner by Strider, who sat unmoved,&#13;
         giving no sign of his thoughts. Frodo leaned back against the wall and took off the Ring. How it came to be on his finger&#13;
         he could not tell. He could only suppose that he had been handling it in his pocket while he sang, and that somehow it had&#13;
         slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a jerk to save his fall. For a moment he wondered if the Ring itself had not played&#13;
         him a trick; perhaps it had tried to reveal itself in response to some wish or command that was felt in the room. He did not&#13;
         like the looks of the men that had gone out.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well?’ said Strider, when he reappeared. ‘Why did you do that? Worse than anything your friends could have said! You have&#13;
         put your foot in it! Or should I say your finger?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said Frodo, annoyed and alarmed.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh yes, you do,’ answered Strider; ‘but we had better wait until the uproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. <em>Baggins</em>, I should like a quiet word with you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What about?’ asked Frodo, ignoring the sudden use of his proper name.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘A matter of some importance – to us both,’ answered</p>&#13;
      <a id="page211"/>&#13;
      <p>Strider, looking Frodo in the eye. ‘You may hear something to your advantage.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very well,’ said Frodo, trying to appear unconcerned. ‘I’ll talk to you later.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace. Mr. Butterbur had come trotting in, and he was now trying to listen to&#13;
         several conflicting accounts of the event at the same time.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I saw him, Mr. Butterbur,’ said a hobbit; ‘or leastways I didn’t see him, if you take my meaning. He just vanished into thin&#13;
         air, in a manner of speaking.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You don’t say, Mr. Mugwort!’ said the landlord, looking puzzled.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes I do!’ replied Mugwort. ‘And I mean what I say, what’s more.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘There’s some mistake somewhere,’ said Butterbur, shaking his head. ‘There was too much of that Mr. Underhill to go vanishing&#13;
         into thin air; or into thick air, as is more likely in this room.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, where is he now?’ cried several voices.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘How should I know? He’s welcome to go where he will, so long as he pays in the morning. There’s Mr. Took, now: he’s not vanished.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, I saw what I saw, and I saw what I didn’t,’ said Mugwort obstinately.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘And I say there’s some mistake,’ repeated Butterbur, picking up the tray and gathering up the broken crockery.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of course there’s a mistake!’ said Frodo. ‘I haven’t vanished. Here I am! I’ve just been having a few words with Strider&#13;
         in the corner.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He came forward into the firelight; but most of the company backed away, even more perturbed than before. They were not in&#13;
         the least satisfied by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after he had fallen. Most of the&#13;
         Hobbits and the Men of Bree went off then and there in a huff, having no fancy for further entertainment that &#13;
         <a id="page212"/>evening. One or two gave Frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves. The Dwarves and the two or three strange&#13;
         Men that still remained got up and said good night to the landlord, but not to Frodo and his friends. Before long no one was&#13;
         left but Strider, who sat on, unnoticed, by the wall.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Mr. Butterbur did not seem much put out. He reckoned, very probably, that his house would be full again on many future nights,&#13;
         until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed. ‘Now what have you been doing, Mr. Underhill?’ he asked. ‘Frightening&#13;
         my customers and breaking up my crocks with your acrobatics!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,’ said Frodo. ‘It was quite unintentional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘All right, Mr. Underhill! But if you’re going to do any more tumbling, or conjuring, or whatever it was, you’d best warn&#13;
         folk beforehand – and warn <em>me</em>. We’re a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way – uncanny, if you understand me; and we don’t take to it all&#13;
         of a sudden.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I shan’t be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. Butterbur, I promise you. And now I think I’ll be getting to bed. We shall&#13;
         be making an early start. Will you see that our ponies are ready by eight o’clock?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very good! But before you go, I should like a word with you in private, Mr. Underhill. Something has just come back to my&#13;
         mind that I ought to tell you. I hope that you’ll not take it amiss. When I’ve seen to a thing or two, I’ll come along to&#13;
         your room, if you’re willing.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Certainly!’ said Frodo; but his heart sank. He wondered how many private talks he would have before he got to bed, and what&#13;
         they would reveal. Were these people all in league against him? He began to suspect even old Butterbur’s fat face of concealing&#13;
         dark designs.&#13;

      <p class="cotx">Frodo, Pippin, and Sam made their way back to the parlour. There was no light. Merry was not there, and the fire had burned&#13;
         low. It was not until they had puffed up the embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots that they discovered Strider&#13;
         had come with them. There he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hallo!’ said Pippin. ‘Who are you, and what do you want?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am called Strider,’ he answered; ‘and though he may have forgotten it, your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,’ said Frodo. ‘What have you to say?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Several things,’ answered Strider. ‘But, of course, I have my price.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you mean?’ asked Frodo sharply.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Don’t be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and give you some good advice – but I shall want a reward.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘And what will that be, pray?’ said Frodo. He suspected now that he had fallen in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably&#13;
         that he had brought only a little money with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he could not spare any of it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No more than you can afford,’ answered Strider with a slow smile, as if he guessed Frodo’s thoughts. ‘Just this: you must&#13;
         take me along with you, until I wish to leave you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh, indeed!’ replied Frodo, surprised, but not much relieved. ‘Even if I wanted another companion, I should not agree to&#13;
         any such thing, until I knew a good deal more about you, and your business.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page214"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Excellent!’ exclaimed Strider, crossing his legs and sitting back comfortably. ‘You seem to be coming to your senses again,&#13;
         and that is all to the good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you what I know, and leave the&#13;
         reward to you. You may be glad to grant it, when you have heard me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Go on then!’ said Frodo. ‘What do you know?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Too much; too many dark things,’ said Strider grimly. ‘But as for your business——’ He got up and went to the door, opened&#13;
         it quickly and looked out. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again. ‘I have quick ears,’ he went on, lowering his voice,&#13;
         ‘and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish. Now,&#13;
         I was behind the hedge this evening on the Road west of Bree, when four hobbits came out of the Downlands. I need not repeat&#13;
         all that they said to old Bombadil or to one another; but one thing interested me. <em>Please remember</em>, said one of them, <em>that the name Baggins must not be mentioned. I am Mr. Underhill, if any name must be given.</em> That interested me so much that I followed them here. I slipped over the gate just behind them. Maybe Mr. Baggins has an&#13;
         honest reason for leaving his name behind; but if so, I should advise him and his friends to be more careful.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t see what interest my name has for anyone in Bree,’ said Frodo angrily, ‘and I have still to learn why it interests&#13;
         you. Mr. Strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, I should advise him to explain it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well answered!’ said Strider laughing. ‘But the explanation is simple: I was looking for a Hobbit called Frodo Baggins. I&#13;
         wanted to find him quickly. I had learned that he was carrying out of the Shire, well, a secret that concerned me and my friends.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now, don’t mistake me!’ he cried, as Frodo rose from his seat, and Sam jumped up with a scowl. ‘I shall take more care of&#13;
         the secret than you do. And care is needed!’ He leaned forward and looked at them. ‘Watch every shadow!’ he said in a low&#13;
         voice. ‘Black horsemen have passed through Bree.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page215"/>&#13;
      <p>On Monday one came down the Greenway, they say; and another appeared later, coming up the Greenway from the south.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">There was a silence. At last Frodo spoke to Pippin and Sam: ‘I ought to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted&#13;
         us,’ he said. ‘And the landlord seems to have heard something. Why did he press us to join the company? And why on earth did&#13;
         we behave so foolishly: we ought to have stayed quiet in here.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It would have been better,’ said Strider. ‘I would have stopped your going into the common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper&#13;
         would not let me in to see you, or take a message.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do you think he——’ began Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, I don’t think any harm of old Butterbur. Only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabonds of my sort.’ Frodo gave&#13;
         him a puzzled look. ‘Well, I have rather a rascally look, have I not?’ said Strider with a curl of his lip and a queer gleam&#13;
         in his eye. ‘But I hope we shall get to know one another better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened at the&#13;
         end of your song. For that little prank——’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was sheer accident!’ interrupted Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wonder,’ said Strider. ‘Accident, then. That accident has made your position dangerous.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hardly more than it was already,’ said Frodo. ‘I knew these horsemen were pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have&#13;
         missed me and to have gone away.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You must not count on that!’ said Strider sharply. ‘They will return. And more are coming. There are others. I know their&#13;
         number. I know these Riders.’ He paused, and his eyes were cold and hard. ‘And there are some folk in Bree who are not to&#13;
         be trusted,’ he went on. ‘Bill Ferny, for instance. He has an evil name in the Bree-land, and queer folk call at his house.&#13;
         You must have noticed him among the company: a swarthy sneering fellow. He was very close with one of the Southern strangers,&#13;
         and they slipped out together just after &#13;
         <a id="page216"/>your “accident”. Not all of those Southerners mean well; and as for Ferny, he would sell anything to anybody; or make mischief&#13;
         for amusement.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What will Ferny sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?’ said Frodo, still determined not to understand Strider’s&#13;
         hints.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘News of you, of course,’ answered Strider. ‘An account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people. After&#13;
         that they would hardly need to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this&#13;
         night is over. Is that enough? You can do as you like about my reward: take me as a guide or not. But I may say that I know&#13;
         all the lands between the Shire and the Misty Mountains, for I have wandered over them for many years. I am older than I look.&#13;
         I might prove useful. You will have to leave the open road after tonight; for the horsemen will watch it night and day. You&#13;
         may escape from Bree, and be allowed to go forward while the Sun is up; but you won’t go far. They will come on you in the&#13;
         wild, in some dark place where there is no help. Do you wish them to find you? They are terrible!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain, and his hands clenched the arms&#13;
         of his chair. The room was very quiet and still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a while he sat with unseeing&#13;
         eyes as if walking in distant memory or listening to sounds in the Night far away.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There!’ he cried after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow. ‘Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do.&#13;
         You fear them, but you do not fear them enough, yet. Tomorrow you will have to escape, if you can. Strider can take you by&#13;
         paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have him?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There was a heavy silence. Frodo made no answer; his mind was confused with doubt and fear. Sam frowned, and looked at his&#13;
         master; and at last he broke out:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘With your leave, Mr. Frodo, I’d say <em>no</em>! This Strider here, &#13;
         <a id="page217"/>he warns and he says take care; and I say <em>yes</em> to that, and let’s begin with him. He comes out of the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk. He knows something,&#13;
         that’s plain, and more than I like; but it’s no reason why we should let him go leading us out into some dark place far from&#13;
         help, as he puts it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. Strider did not reply to Sam, but turned his keen eyes on Frodo. Frodo caught his&#13;
         glance and looked away. ‘No,’ he said slowly. ‘I don’t agree. I think, I think you are not really as you choose to look. You&#13;
         began to talk to me like the Bree-folk, but your voice has changed. Still Sam seems right in this: I don’t see why you should&#13;
         warn us to take care, and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise? Who are you? What do you really know about –&#13;
         about my business; and how do you know it?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The lesson in caution has been well learned,’ said Strider with a grim smile. ‘But caution is one thing and wavering is another.&#13;
         You will never get to Rivendell now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You must make up your mind. I will answer&#13;
         some of your questions, if that will help you to do so. But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me already?&#13;
         Still here it is——’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. Butterbur had arrived with candles, and behind him was Nob with cans of&#13;
         hot water. Strider withdrew into a dark corner.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I’ve come to bid you good night,’ said the landlord, putting the candles on the table. ‘Nob! Take the water to the rooms!’&#13;
         He came in and shut the door.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It’s like this,’ he began, hesitating and looking troubled. ‘If I’ve done any harm, I’m sorry indeed. But one thing drives&#13;
         out another, as you’ll admit; and I’m a busy man. But first one thing and then another this week have jogged my memory, as&#13;
         the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see, I was asked to look out for hobbits of the Shire, and for one by the name&#13;
         of Baggins in particular.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page218"/>&#13;
      <p>‘And what has that got to do with me?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah! you know best,’ said the landlord, knowingly. ‘I won’t give you away; but I was told that this Baggins would be going&#13;
         by the name of Underhill, and I was given a description that fits you well enough, if I may say so.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Indeed! Let’s have it then!’ said Frodo, unwisely interrupting.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>A stout little fellow with red cheeks</em>,’ said Mr. Butterbur solemnly. Pippin chuckled, but Sam looked indignant. ‘<em>That won’t help you much; it goes for most hobbits, Barley</em>, he says to me,’ continued Mr. Butterbur with a glance at Pippin. ‘<em>But this one is taller than some and fairer than most, and he has a cleft in his chin: perky chap with a bright eye.</em> Begging your pardon, but he said it, not me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>He</em> said it? And who was he?’ asked Frodo eagerly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah! That was Gandalf, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is, but he’s a good friend of mine, whether or no. But&#13;
         now I don’t know what he’ll have to say to me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into a block of wood, I shouldn’t&#13;
         wonder. He’s a bit hasty. Still what’s done can’t be undone.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, what have you done?’ said Frodo, getting impatient with the slow unravelling of Butterbur’s thoughts.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where was I?’ said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers. ‘Ah, yes! Old Gandalf. Three months back he walked right&#13;
         into my room without a knock. <em>Barley</em>, he says, <em>I’m off in the morning. Will you do something for me? You’ve only to name it</em>, I said. <em>I’m in a hurry</em>, said he, <em>and I’ve no time myself, but I want a message took to the Shire. Have you anyone you can send, and trust to go? I can find&#13;
            someone</em>, I said, <em>tomorrow, maybe, or the day after. Make it tomorrow</em>, he says, and then he gave me a letter.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It’s addressed plain enough,’ said Mr. Butterbur, producing a letter from his pocket, and reading out the address slowly&#13;
         and proudly (he valued his reputation as a lettered man):&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page219"/>&#13;
      <h1><em>Mr. FRODO BAGGINS, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE.</em></h1>&#13;
      <p>‘A letter for me from Gandalf!’ cried Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah!’ said Mr. Butterbur. ‘Then your right name is Baggins?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is,’ said Frodo, ‘and you had better give me that letter at once, and explain why you never sent it. That’s what you came&#13;
         to tell me, I suppose, though you’ve taken a long time to come to the point.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Poor Mr. Butterbur looked troubled. ‘You’re right, master,’ he said, ‘and I beg your pardon. And I’m mortal afraid of what&#13;
         Gandalf will say, if harm comes of it. But I didn’t keep it back a-purpose. I put it by safe. Then I couldn’t find nobody&#13;
         willing to go to the Shire next day, nor the day after, and none of my own folk were to spare; and then one thing after another&#13;
         drove it out of my mind. I’m a busy man. I’ll do what I can to set matters right, and if there’s any help I can give, you’ve&#13;
         only to name it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Leaving the letter aside, I promised Gandalf no less. <em>Barley</em>, he says to me, <em>this friend of mine from the Shire, he may be coming out this way before long, him and another. He’ll be calling himself Underhill.&#13;
            Mind that! But you need ask no questions. And if I’m not with him, he may be in trouble, and he may need help. Do whatever&#13;
            you can for him, and I’ll be grateful</em>, he says. And here you are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you mean?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘These black men,’ said the landlord lowering his voice. ‘They’re looking for <em>Baggins</em>, and if they mean well, then I’m a hobbit. It was on Monday, and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming. Uncanny,&#13;
         I called it. Nob, he came and told me that two black men were at the door asking for a hobbit called Baggins. Nob’s hair was&#13;
         all stood on end. I bid the black fellows be off, and slammed the door on them; but they’ve been asking the same question&#13;
         all the way to Archet, I hear. And that Ranger, Strider, he’s been asking &#13;
         <a id="page220"/>questions, too. Tried to get in here to see you, before you’d had bite or sup, he did.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He did!’ said Strider suddenly, coming forward into the light. ‘And much trouble would have been saved, if you had let him&#13;
         in, Barliman.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The landlord jumped with surprise. ‘You!’ he cried. ‘You’re always popping up. What do you want now?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘He’s here with my leave,’ said Frodo. ‘He came to offer me his help.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, you know your own business, maybe,’ said Mr. Butterbur, looking suspiciously at Strider. ‘But if I was in your plight,&#13;
         I wouldn’t take up with a Ranger.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then who would you take up with?’ asked Strider. ‘A fat innkeeper who only remembers his own name because people shout it&#13;
         at him all day? They cannot stay in <em>The Pony</em> for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long road before them. Will you go with them and keep the black men off?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Me? Leave Bree! I wouldn’t do that for any money,’ said Mr. Butterbur, looking really scared. ‘But why can’t you stay here&#13;
         quiet for a bit, Mr. Underhill? What are all these queer goings on? What are these black men after, and where do they come&#13;
         from, I’d like to know?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I’m sorry I can’t explain it all,’ answered Frodo. ‘I am tired and very worried, and it’s a long tale. But if you mean to&#13;
         help me, I ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house. These Black Riders: I am not sure,&#13;
         but I think, I fear they come from——’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘They come from Mordor,’ said Strider in a low voice. ‘From Mordor, Barliman, if that means anything to you.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Save us!’ cried Mr. Butterbur turning pale; the name evidently was known to him. ‘That is the worst news that has come to&#13;
         Bree in my time.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is,’ said Frodo. ‘Are you still willing to help me?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am,’ said Mr. Butterbur. ‘More than ever. Though I don’t know what the likes of me can do against, against——’ he faltered.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Against the Shadow in the East,’ said Strider quietly. ‘Not &#13;
         <a id="page221"/>much, Barliman, but every little helps. You can let Mr. Underhill stay here tonight, as Mr. Underhill; and you can forget&#13;
         the name of Baggins, till he is far away.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I’ll do that,’ said Butterbur. ‘But they’ll find out he’s here without help from me, I’m afraid. It’s a pity Mr. Baggins&#13;
         drew attention to himself this evening, to say no more. The story of that Mr. Bilbo’s going off has been heard before tonight&#13;
         in Bree. Even our Nob has been doing some guessing in his slow pate; and there are others in Bree quicker in the uptake than&#13;
         he is.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, we can only hope the Riders won’t come back yet,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I hope not, indeed,’ said Butterbur. ‘But spooks or no spooks, they won’t get in <em>The Pony</em> so easy. Don’t you worry till the morning. Nob’ll say no word. No black man shall pass my doors, while I can stand on my&#13;
         legs. Me and my folk’ll keep watch tonight; but you had best get some sleep, if you can.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘In any case we must be called at dawn,’ said Frodo. ‘We must get off as early as possible. Breakfast at six-thirty, please.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Right! I’ll see to the orders,’ said the landlord. ‘Good night, Mr. Baggins – Underhill, I should say! Good night – now,&#13;
         bless me! Where’s your Mr. Brandybuck?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo with sudden anxiety. They had forgotten all about Merry, and it was getting late. ‘I am afraid&#13;
         he is out. He said something about going for a breath of air.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, you do want looking after and no mistake: your party might be on a holiday!’ said Butterbur. ‘I must go and bar the&#13;
         doors quick, but I’ll see your friend is let in when he comes. I’d better send Nob to look for him. Good night to you all!’&#13;
         At last Mr. Butterbur went out, with another doubtful look at Strider and a shake of his head. His footsteps retreated down&#13;
         the passage.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘Well?’ said Strider. ‘When are you going to open that letter?’ Frodo looked carefully at the seal before he broke it. It&#13;
         seemed certainly to be Gandalf ’s. Inside, written in the wizard’s strong but graceful script, was the following message:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page222"/>&#13;
      <p><em>THE PRANCING PONY, BREE. Midyear’s Day, Shire Year, 1418.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="lsal"><em>Dear Frodo,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="l"><em>Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better leave Bag End soon, and get out of the Shire before the&#13;
            end of July at latest. I will return as soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I find that you are gone. Leave a message&#13;
            for me here, if you pass through Bree. You can trust the landlord (Butterbur). You may meet a friend of mine on the Road:&#13;
            a Man, lean, dark, tall, by some called Strider. He knows our business and will help you. Make for Rivendell. There I hope&#13;
            we may meet again. If I do not come, Elrond will advise you.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="lsig"><em>Yours in haste</em><br/><em>GANDALF.</em><img alt="art" src="images/Art_P032b.jpg"/></p>&#13;
      <p><em>PS. Do NOT use It again, not for any reason whatever! Do not travel by night!</em><img alt="art" src="images/Art_P032b.jpg"/></p>&#13;
      <p><em>PPS. Make sure that it is the real Strider. There are many strange men on the roads. His true name is Aragorn.</em><img alt="art" src="images/Art_P032b.jpg"/></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>All that is gold does not glitter,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Not all those who wander are lost;</em></p>&#13;

      <p><em>PPPS.</em> I hope Butterbur sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his memory is like a lumber-room: thing wanted always buried. If he&#13;
         forgets, I shall roast him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="ca1">Fare Well! <img alt="art" src="images/Art_P222.jpg"/></p>&#13;
      <a id="page223"/>&#13;
      <p>Frodo read the letter to himself, and then passed it to Pippin and Sam. ‘Really old Butterbur has made a mess of things!’&#13;
         he said. ‘He deserves roasting. If I had got this at once, we might all have been safe in Rivendell by now. But what can have&#13;
         happened to Gandalf? He writes as if he was going into great danger.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He has been doing that for many years,’ said Strider.</p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering about Gandalf ’s second postscript. ‘Why didn’t you tell me that you&#13;
         were Gandalf ’s friend at once?’ he asked. ‘It would have saved time.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?’ said Strider. ‘I knew nothing of this letter. For all I knew I had&#13;
         to persuade you to trust me without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did not intend to tell you all about myself&#13;
         at once. I had to study <em>you</em> first, and make sure of you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as I had made up my mind, I was ready to&#13;
         tell you whatever you asked. But I must admit,’ he added with a queer laugh, ‘that I hoped you would take to me for my own&#13;
         sake. A hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship. But there, I believe my looks are against me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘They are – at first sight at any rate,’ laughed Pippin with sudden relief after reading Gandalf ’s letter. ‘But handsome&#13;
         is as handsome does, as we say in the Shire; and I daresay we shall all look much the same after lying for days in hedges&#13;
         and ditches.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It would take more than a few days, or weeks, or years, of wandering in the Wild to make you look like Strider,’ he answered.&#13;
         ‘And you would die first, unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin subsided; but Sam was not daunted, and he still eyed Strider dubiously. ‘How do we know you are the Strider that Gandalf&#13;
         speaks about?’ he demanded. ‘You never mentioned Gandalf, till this letter came out. You might be a play-acting spy, for all&#13;
         I can see, trying to get us to go with &#13;
         <a id="page224"/>you. You might have done in the real Strider and took his clothes. What have you to say to that?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That you are a stout fellow,’ answered Strider; ‘but I am afraid my only answer to you, Sam Gamgee, is this. If I had killed&#13;
         the real Strider, I could kill you. And I should have killed you already without so much talk. If I was after the Ring, I&#13;
         could have it – now!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a light, keen and commanding. Throwing back his cloak,&#13;
         he laid his hand on the hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side. They did not dare to move. Sam sat wide-mouthed&#13;
         staring at him dumbly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But I <em>am</em> the real Strider, fortunately,’ he said, looking down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile. ‘I am Aragorn son&#13;
         of Arathorn; and if by life or death I can save you, I will.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">There was a long silence. At last Frodo spoke with hesitation. ‘I believed that you were a friend before the letter came,’&#13;
         he said, ‘or at least I wished to. You have frightened me several times tonight, but never in the way that servants of the&#13;
         Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think one of his spies would – well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I see,’ laughed Strider. ‘I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? <em>All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost.</em>’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Did the verses apply to you then?’ asked Frodo. ‘I could not make out what they were about. But how did you know that they&#13;
         were in Gandalf ’s letter, if you have never seen it?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I did not know,’ he answered. ‘But I am Aragorn, and those verses go with that name.’ He drew out his sword, and they saw&#13;
         that the blade was indeed broken a foot below the hilt. ‘Not much use is it, Sam?’ said Strider. ‘But the time is near when&#13;
         it shall be forged anew.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam said nothing.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well,’ said Strider, ‘with Sam’s permission we will call that settled. Strider shall be your guide. And now I think it is&#13;
         time you went to bed and took what rest you can. We shall have &#13;
         <a id="page225"/>a rough road tomorrow. Even if we are allowed to leave Bree unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed. But&#13;
         I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know one or two ways out of Bree-land other than the main road. If once we&#13;
         shake off the pursuit, I shall make for Weathertop.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Weathertop?’ said Sam. ‘What’s that?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is a hill, just to the north of the Road, about half way from here to Rivendell. It commands a wide view all round; and&#13;
         there we shall have a chance to look about us. Gandalf will make for that point, if he follows us. After Weathertop our journey&#13;
         will become more difficult, and we shall have to choose between various dangers.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘When did you last see Gandalf?’ asked Frodo. ‘Do you know where he is, or what he is doing?’</p>&#13;
      <p>Strider looked grave. ‘I do not know,’ he said. ‘I came west with him in the spring. I have often kept watch on the borders&#13;
         of the Shire in the last few years, when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We last met on the first of May:&#13;
         at Sarn Ford down the Brandywine. He told me that his business with you had gone well, and that you would be starting for&#13;
         Rivendell in the last week of September. As I knew he was at your side, I went away on a journey of my own. And that has proved&#13;
         ill; for plainly some news reached him, and I was not at hand to help.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am troubled, for the first time since I have known him. We should have had messages, even if he could not come himself.&#13;
         When I returned, many days ago, I heard the ill news. The tidings had gone far and wide that Gandalf was missing and the horsemen&#13;
         had been seen. It was the Elven-folk of Gildor that told me this; and later they told me that you had left your home; but&#13;
         there was no news of your leaving Buckland. I have been watching the East Road anxiously.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do you think the Black Riders have anything to do with it – with Gandalf ’s absence, I mean?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except the Enemy himself,’ said Strider. ‘But do not &#13;
         <a id="page226"/>give up hope! Gandalf is greater than you Shire-folk know – as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys. But this business&#13;
         of ours will be his greatest task.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin yawned. ‘I am sorry,’ he said, ‘but I am dead tired. In spite of all the danger and worry I must go to bed, or sleep&#13;
         where I sit. Where is that silly fellow, Merry? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in the dark to look for him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the passage. Merry came in with a rush followed by Nob.&#13;
         He shut the door hastily, and leaned against it. He was out of breath. They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he&#13;
         gasped: ‘I have seen them, Frodo! I have seen them! Black Riders!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Black Riders!’ cried Frodo. ‘Where?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for an hour. Then as you did not come back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back&#13;
         again and was standing just outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I shivered and felt that something&#13;
         horrible was creeping near: there was a sort of deeper shade among the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of the&#13;
         lamplight. It slid away at once into the dark without a sound. There was no horse.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Which way did it go?’ asked Strider, suddenly and sharply.</p>&#13;
      <p>Merry started, noticing the stranger for the first time. ‘Go on!’ said Frodo. ‘This is a friend of Gandalf ’s. I will explain&#13;
         later.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It seemed to make off up the Road, eastward,’ continued Merry. ‘I tried to follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once;&#13;
         but I went round the corner and on as far as the last house on the Road.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Strider looked at Merry with wonder. ‘You have a stout heart,’ he said; ‘but it was foolish.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know,’ said Merry. ‘Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could hardly help myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway,&#13;
         I went, and suddenly I heard voices by the hedge.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page227"/>&#13;
      <p>One was muttering; and the other was whispering, or hissing. I couldn’t hear a word that was said. I did not creep any closer,&#13;
         because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt terrified, and I turned back, and was just going to bolt home, when something&#13;
         came behind me and I . . . I fell over.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I found him, sir,’ put in Nob. ‘Mr. Butterbur sent me out with a lantern. I went down to West-gate, and then back up towards&#13;
         South-gate. Just nigh Bill Ferny’s house I thought I could see something in the Road. I couldn’t swear to it, but it looked&#13;
         to me as if two men was stooping over something, lifting it. I gave a shout, but when I got up to the spot there was no signs&#13;
         of them, and only Mr. Brandybuck lying by the roadside. He seemed to be asleep. “I thought I had fallen into deep water,”&#13;
         he says to me, when I shook him. Very queer he was, and as soon as I had roused him, he got up and ran back here like a hare.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am afraid that’s true,’ said Merry, ‘though I don’t know what I said. I had an ugly dream, which I can’t remember. I went&#13;
         to pieces. I don’t know what came over me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do,’ said Strider. ‘The Black Breath. The Riders must have left their horses outside, and passed back through the South-gate&#13;
         in secret. They will know all the news now, for they have visited Bill Ferny; and probably that Southerner was a spy as well.&#13;
         Something may happen in the night, before we leave Bree.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What will happen?’ said Merry. ‘Will they attack the inn?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, I think not,’ said Strider. ‘They are not all here yet. And in any case that is not their way. In dark and loneliness&#13;
         they are strongest; they will not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people – not until they are desperate,&#13;
         not while all the long leagues of Eriador still lie before us. But their power is in terror, and already some in Bree are&#13;
         in their clutch. They will drive these wretches to some evil work: Ferny, and some of the strangers, and, maybe, the gatekeeper&#13;
         too. They had words with Harry at West-gate on Monday. I was watching them. He was white and shaking when they left him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page228"/>&#13;
      <p>‘We seem to have enemies all round,’ said Frodo. ‘What are we to do?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Stay here, and do not go to your rooms! They are sure to have found out which those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking&#13;
         north and close to the ground. We will all remain together and bar this window and the door. But first Nob and I will fetch&#13;
         your luggage.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>While Strider was gone, Frodo gave Merry a rapid account of all that had happened since supper. Merry was still reading and&#13;
         pondering Gandalf ’s letter when Strider and Nob returned.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well Masters,’ said Nob, ‘I’ve ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice&#13;
         imitation of your head with a brown woollen mat, Mr. Bag – Underhill, sir,’ he added with a grin.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin laughed. ‘Very life-like!’ he said. ‘But what will happen when they have penetrated the disguise?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We shall see,’ said Strider. ‘Let us hope to hold the fort till morning.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good night to you,’ said Nob, and went off to take his part in the watch on the doors.</p>&#13;
      <p>Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed a low chair against the door and shut the window. Peering&#13;
         out, Frodo saw that the night was still clear. The Sickle&#13;
         <sup>&#13;
            <a href="Fellowshipofth_foot-1.html#footnote_number_7">*</a>&#13;
         </sup>&#13;
         <a id="footnote_reference_7"/> was swinging bright above the shoulders of Bree-hill. He then closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains&#13;
         together. Strider built up the fire and blew out all the candles.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the hearth; but Strider settled himself in the chair against&#13;
         the door. They talked for a little, for Merry still had several questions to ask.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Jumped over the Moon!’ chuckled Merry as he rolled himself in his blanket. ‘Very ridiculous of you, Frodo! But I wish</p>&#13;
      <a id="page229"/>&#13;
      <p>I had been there to see. The worthies of Bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I hope so,’ said Strider. Then they all fell silent, and one by one the hobbits dropped off to sleep.</p>&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-11">A KNIFE IN THE DARK</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">As they prepared for sleep in the inn at Bree, darkness lay on Buckland; a mist strayed in the dells and along the river-bank.&#13;
         The house at Crickhollow stood silent. Fatty Bolger opened the door cautiously and peered out. A feeling of fear had been&#13;
         growing on him all day, and he was unable to rest or go to bed: there was a brooding threat in the breathless night-air. As&#13;
         he stared out into the gloom, a black shadow moved under the trees; the gate seemed to open of its own accord and close again&#13;
         without a sound. Terror seized him. He shrank back, and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall. Then he shut and locked&#13;
         the door.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The night deepened. There came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the lane. Outside the gate they stopped, and&#13;
         three black figures entered, like shades of night creeping across the ground. One went to the door, one to the corner of the&#13;
         house on either side; and there they stood, as still as the shadows of stones, while night went slowly on. The house and the&#13;
         quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away. The cold hour before dawn was passing. The figure by the&#13;
         door moved. In the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a&#13;
         blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Open, in the name of Mordor!’ said a voice thin and menacing.</p>&#13;
      <p>At a second blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and lock broken. The black figures passed swiftly in.</p>&#13;
      <p>At that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent the night like fire on a hill-top.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page231"/>&#13;
      <h1><strong><small>AWAKE! FEAR! FIRE! FOES! AWAKE!</small></strong></h1>&#13;
      <p>Fatty Bolger had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from the garden, he knew that he must run for it,&#13;
         or perish. And run he did, out of the back door, through the garden, and over the fields. When he reached the nearest house,&#13;
         more than a mile away, he collapsed on the doorstep. ‘No, no, no!’ he was crying. ‘No, not me! I haven’t got it!’ It was some&#13;
         time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about. At last they got the idea that enemies were in Buckland, some&#13;
         strange invasion from the Old Forest. And then they lost no more time.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <h1><strong><small>FEAR! FIRE! FOES!</small></strong></h1>&#13;
      <p>The Brandybucks were blowing the Horn-call of Buckland, that had not been sounded for a hundred years, not since the white&#13;
         wolves came in the Fell Winter, when the Brandywine was frozen over.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <h1><strong><small>AWAKE! AWAKE!</small></strong></h1>&#13;
      <p>Far away answering horns were heard. The alarm was spreading.</p>&#13;
      <p>The black figures fled from the house. One of them let fall a hobbit-cloak on the step, as he ran. In the lane the noise of&#13;
         hoofs broke out, and gathering to a gallop, went hammering away into the darkness. All about Crickhollow there was the sound&#13;
         of horns blowing, and voices crying and feet running. But the Black Riders rode like a gale to the North-gate. Let the little&#13;
         people blow! Sauron would deal with them later. Meanwhile they had another errand: they knew now that the house was empty&#13;
         and the Ring had gone. They rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the Shire.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page232"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">In the early night Frodo woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some sound or presence had disturbed him. He saw that Strider&#13;
         was sitting alert in his chair: his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire, which had been tended and was burning brightly;&#13;
         but he made no sign or movement.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs. The wind&#13;
         seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly. He opened his eyes, and heard&#13;
         a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard. Strider had drawn the curtains and pushed back the shutters with a clang. The first&#13;
         grey light of day was in the room, and a cold air was coming through the open window.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As soon as Strider had roused them all, he led the way to their bedrooms. When they saw them they were glad that they had&#13;
         taken his advice: the windows had been forced open and were swinging, and the curtains were flapping; the beds were tossed&#13;
         about, and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the floor; the brown mat was torn to pieces.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Strider immediately went to fetch the landlord. Poor Mr. Butterbur looked sleepy and frightened. He had hardly closed his&#13;
         eyes all night (so he said), but he had never heard a sound.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Never has such a thing happened in my time!’ he cried, raising his hands in horror. ‘Guests unable to sleep in their beds,&#13;
         and good bolsters ruined and all! What are we coming to?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Dark times,’ said Strider. ‘But for the present you may be left in peace, when you have got rid of us. We will leave at once.&#13;
         Never mind about breakfast: a drink and a bite standing will have to do. We shall be packed in a few minutes.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Mr. Butterbur hurried off to see that their ponies were got ready, and to fetch them a ‘bite’. But very soon he came back&#13;
         in dismay. The ponies had vanished! The stable-doors had all been opened in the night, and they were gone: not only Merry’s&#13;
         ponies, but every other horse and beast in the place.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo was crushed by the news. How could they hope to reach Rivendell on foot, pursued by mounted enemies? They &#13;
         <a id="page233"/>might as well set out for the Moon. Strider sat silent for a while, looking at the hobbits, as if he was weighing up their&#13;
         strength and courage.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,’ he said at last, thoughtfully, as if he guessed what Frodo had in mind. ‘We&#13;
         should not go much slower on foot, not on the roads that I mean to take. I was going to walk in any case. It is the food and&#13;
         stores that trouble me. We cannot count on getting anything to eat between here and Rivendell, except what we take with us;&#13;
         and we ought to take plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or forced to go round-about, far out of the direct way. How much&#13;
         are you prepared to carry on your backs?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘As much as we must,’ said Pippin with a sinking heart, but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked (or felt).</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I can carry enough for two,’ said Sam defiantly.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Can’t anything be done, Mr. Butterbur?’ asked Frodo. ‘Can’t we get a couple of ponies in the village, or even one just for&#13;
         the baggage? I don’t suppose we could hire them, but we might be able to buy them,’ he added, doubtfully, wondering if he&#13;
         could afford it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I doubt it,’ said the landlord unhappily. ‘The two or three riding-ponies that there were in Bree were stabled in my yard,&#13;
         and they’re gone. As for other animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not, there are very few of them in Bree, and&#13;
         they won’t be for sale. But I’ll do what I can. I’ll rout out Bob and send him round as soon as may be.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Strider reluctantly, ‘you had better do that. I am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at least. But so&#13;
         ends all hope of starting early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure.&#13;
         That was part of their plan, no doubt.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is one crumb of comfort,’ said Merry, ‘and more than a crumb, I hope: we can have breakfast while we wait – and sit&#13;
         down to it. Let’s get hold of Nob!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page234"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">In the end there was more than three hours’ delay. Bob came back with the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love&#13;
         or money in the neighbourhood – except one: Bill Ferny had one that he might possibly sell. ‘A poor old half-starved creature&#13;
         it is,’ said Bob; ‘but he won’t part with it for less than thrice its worth, seeing how you’re placed, not if I knows Bill&#13;
         Ferny.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Bill Ferny?’ said Frodo. ‘Isn’t there some trick? Wouldn’t the beast bolt back to him with all our stuff, or help in tracking&#13;
         us, or something?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wonder,’ said Strider. ‘But I cannot imagine any animal running home to him, once it got away. I fancy this is only an&#13;
         afterthought of kind Master Ferny’s: just a way of increasing his profits from the affair. The chief danger is that the poor&#13;
         beast is probably at death’s door. But there does not seem any choice. What does he want for it?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Bill Ferny’s price was twelve silver pennies; and that was indeed at least three times the pony’s value in those parts. It&#13;
         proved to be a bony, underfed, and dispirited animal; but it did not look like dying just yet. Mr. Butterbur paid for it himself,&#13;
         and offered Merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals. He was an honest man, and well-off as&#13;
         things were reckoned in Bree; but thirty silver pennies was a sore blow to him, and being cheated by Bill Ferny made it harder&#13;
         to bear.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As a matter of fact he came out on the right side in the end. It turned out later that only one horse had been actually stolen.&#13;
         The others had been driven off, or had bolted in terror, and were found wandering in different corners of the Bree-land. Merry’s&#13;
         ponies had escaped altogether, and eventually (having a good deal of sense) they made their way to the Downs in search of&#13;
         Fatty Lumpkin. So they came under the care of Tom Bombadil for a while, and were well-off. But when news of the events at&#13;
         Bree came to Tom’s ears, he sent them to Mr. Butterbur, who thus got five good beasts at a very fair price. They had to work&#13;
         harder in Bree, but Bob treated them well; so on the whole they were lucky: they &#13;
         <a id="page235"/>missed a dark and dangerous journey. But they never came to Rivendell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>However, in the meanwhile for all Mr. Butterbur knew his money was gone for good, or for bad. And he had other troubles. For&#13;
         there was a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the inn. The southern&#13;
         travellers had lost several horses and blamed the innkeeper loudly, until it became known that one of their own number had&#13;
         also disappeared in the night, none other than Bill Ferny’s squint-eyed companion. Suspicion fell on him at once.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If you pick up with a horse-thief, and bring him to my house,’ said Butterbur angrily, ‘you ought to pay for all the damage&#13;
         yourselves and not come shouting at me. Go and ask Ferny where your handsome friend is!’ But it appeared that he was nobody’s&#13;
         friend, and nobody could recollect when he had joined their party.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">After their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together further supplies for the longer journey they were now expecting.&#13;
         It was close on ten o’clock before they at last got off. By that time the whole of Bree was buzzing with excitement. Frodo’s&#13;
         vanishing trick; the appearance of the black horsemen; the robbing of the stables; and not least the news that Strider the&#13;
         Ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits, made such a tale as would last for many uneventful years. Most of the inhabitants&#13;
         of Bree and Staddle, and many even from Combe and Archet, were crowded in the road to see the travellers start. The other&#13;
         guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windows.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Strider had changed his mind, and had decided to leave Bree by the main road. Any attempt to set off across country at once&#13;
         would only make matters worse: half the inhabitants would follow them, to see what they were up to, and to prevent them from&#13;
         trespassing.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They said farewell to Nob and Bob, and took leave of Mr. Butterbur with many thanks. ‘I hope we shall meet again &#13;
         <a id="page236"/>some day, when things are merry once more,’ said Frodo. ‘I should like nothing better than to stay in your house in peace&#13;
         for a while.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of the crowd. Not all the faces were friendly, nor all the words&#13;
         that were shouted. But Strider seemed to be held in awe by most of the Bree-landers, and those that he stared at shut their&#13;
         mouths and drew away. He walked in front with Frodo; next came Merry and Pippin; and last came Sam leading the pony, which&#13;
         was laden with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it; but already it looked less dejected, as if it approved&#13;
         of the change in its fortunes. Sam was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He had a pocket full of them: a parting present from&#13;
         Nob and Bob. ‘Apples for walking, and a pipe for sitting,’ he said. ‘But I reckon I’ll miss them both before long.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of doors, or popped over walls and fences, as they passed.&#13;
         But as they drew near to the further gate, Frodo saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick hedge: the last house in the village.&#13;
         In one of the windows he caught a glimpse of a sallow face with sly, slanting eyes; but it vanished at once.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So that’s where that southerner is hiding!’ he thought. ‘He looks more than half like a goblin.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Over the hedge another man was staring boldly. He had heavy black brows, and dark scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in&#13;
         a sneer. He was smoking a short black pipe. As they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Morning, Longshanks!’ he said. ‘Off early? Found some friends at last?’ Strider nodded, but did not answer.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Morning, my little friends!’ he said to the others. ‘I suppose you know who you’ve taken up with? That’s Stick-at-naught&#13;
         Strider, that is! Though I’ve heard other names not so pretty. Watch out tonight! And you, Sammie, don’t go ill-treating my&#13;
         poor old pony! Pah!’ He spat again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam turned quickly. ‘And you, Ferny,’ he said, ‘put your ugly face out of sight, or it will get hurt.’ With a sudden flick,&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page237"/>quick as lightning, an apple left his hand and hit Bill square on the nose. He ducked too late, and curses came from behind&#13;
         the hedge. ‘Waste of a good apple,’ said Sam regretfully, and strode on.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At last they left the village behind. The escort of children and stragglers that had followed them got tired and turned back&#13;
         at the South-gate. Passing through, they kept on along the Road for some miles. It bent to the left, curving back into its&#13;
         eastward line as it rounded the feet of Bree-hill, and then it began to run swiftly downwards into wooded country. To their&#13;
         left they could see some of the houses and hobbit-holes of Staddle on the gentler south-eastern slopes of the hill; down in&#13;
         a deep hollow away north of the Road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed where Combe lay; Archet was hidden in the&#13;
         trees beyond.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After the Road had run down some way, and had left Bree-hill standing tall and brown behind, they came on a narrow track that&#13;
         led off towards the North. ‘This is where we leave the open and take to cover,’ said Strider.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not a “short cut”, I hope,’ said Pippin. ‘Our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah, but you had not got me with you then,’ laughed Strider. ‘My cuts, short or long, don’t go wrong.’ He took a look up and&#13;
         down the Road. No one was in sight; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>His plan, as far as they could understand it without knowing the country, was to go towards Archet at first, but to bear right&#13;
         and pass it on the east, and then to steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to Weathertop Hill. In that way they&#13;
         would, if all went well, cut off a great loop of the Road, which further on bent southwards to avoid the Midgewater Marshes.&#13;
         But, of course, they would have to pass through the marshes themselves, and Strider’s description of them was not encouraging.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>However, in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant.</p>&#13;
      <p>Indeed, if it had not been for the disturbing events of the &#13;
         <a id="page238"/>night before, they would have enjoyed this part of the journey better than any up to that time. The sun was shining, clear&#13;
         but not too hot. The woods in the valley were still leafy and full of colour, and seemed peaceful and wholesome. Strider guided&#13;
         them confidently among the many crossing paths, although left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss. He was taking&#13;
         a wandering course with many turns and doublings, to put off any pursuit.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Bill Ferny will have watched where we left the Road, for certain,’ he said; ‘though I don’t think he will follow us himself.&#13;
         He knows the land round here well enough, but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood. It is what he may tell others that&#13;
         I am afraid of. I don’t suppose they are far away. If they think we have made for Archet, so much the better.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Whether because of Strider’s skill or for some other reason, they saw no sign and heard no sound of any other living thing&#13;
         all that day: neither two-footed, except birds; nor four-footed, except one fox and a few squirrels. The next day they began&#13;
         to steer a steady course eastwards; and still all was quiet and peaceful. On the third day out from Bree they came out of&#13;
         the Chetwood. The land had been falling steadily, ever since they turned aside from the Road, and they now entered a wide&#13;
         flat expanse of country, much more difficult to manage. They were far beyond the borders of the Bree-land, out in the pathless&#13;
         wilderness, and drawing near to the Midgewater Marshes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and there they came upon pools, and wide stretches of reeds and rushes&#13;
         filled with the warbling of little hidden birds. They had to pick their way carefully to keep both dry-footed and on their&#13;
         proper course. At first they made fair progress, but as they went on, their passage became slower and more dangerous. The&#13;
         marshes were bewildering and treacherous, and there was no permanent trail even for Rangers to find through their shifting&#13;
         quagmires. The flies began to torment them, and the air was full of clouds of tiny midges that crept up their sleeves and&#13;
         breeches and into their hair.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page239"/>&#13;
      <p>‘I am being eaten alive!’ cried Pippin. ‘Midgewater! There are more midges than water!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do they live on when they can’t get hobbit?’ asked Sam, scratching his neck.</p>&#13;
      <p>They spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country. Their camping-place was damp, cold, and uncomfortable; and&#13;
         the biting insects would not let them sleep. There were also abominable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks that from&#13;
         the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricket. There were thousands of them, and they squeaked all round, <em>neek-breek</em>, <em>breek-neek</em>, unceasingly all the night, until the hobbits were nearly frantic.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The next day, the fourth, was little better, and the night almost as comfortless. Though the Neekerbreekers (as Sam called&#13;
         them) had been left behind, the midges still pursued them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it&#13;
         flashed and faded many times. It was not the dawn, for that was still some hours off.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What is the light?’ he said to Strider, who had risen, and was standing, gazing ahead into the night.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not know,’ Strider answered. ‘It is too distant to make out. It is like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the white flashes, and against them the tall dark figure of&#13;
         Strider, standing silent and watchful. At last he passed into uneasy sleep.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the last straggling pools and reed-beds of the marshes behind them.&#13;
         The land before them began steadily to rise again. Away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills. The highest&#13;
         of them was at the right of the line and a little separated from the others. It had a conical top, slightly flattened at the&#13;
         summit.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is Weathertop,’ said Strider. ‘The Old Road, which &#13;
         <a id="page240"/>we have left far away on our right, runs to the south of it and passes not far from its foot. We might reach it by noon tomorrow,&#13;
         if we go straight towards it. I suppose we had better do so.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you mean?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find. It is close to the Road.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes; but the hope is faint. If he comes this way at all, he may not pass through Bree, and so he may not know what we are&#13;
         doing. And anyway, unless by luck we arrive almost together, we shall miss one another; it will not be safe for him or for&#13;
         us to wait there long. If the Riders fail to find us in the wilderness, they are likely to make for Weathertop themselves.&#13;
         It commands a wide view all round. Indeed, there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see us, as we stand&#13;
         here, from that hill-top. Not all the birds are to be trusted, and there are other spies more evil than they are.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. Sam looked up into the pale sky, fearing to see hawks or eagles hovering&#13;
         over them with bright unfriendly eyes. ‘You do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome, Strider!’ he said.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you advise us to do?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I think,’ answered Strider slowly, as if he was not quite sure, ‘I think the best thing is to go as straight eastward from&#13;
         here as we can, to make for the line of hills, not for Weathertop. There we can strike a path I know that runs at their feet;&#13;
         it will bring us to Weathertop from the north and less openly. Then we shall see what we shall see.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">All that day they plodded along, until the cold and early evening came down. The land became drier and more barren; but mists&#13;
         and vapours lay behind them on the marshes. A few melancholy birds were piping and wailing, until the round red sun sank slowly&#13;
         into the western shadows; then an empty silence fell. The hobbits thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the&#13;
         cheerful windows of Bag End far away.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page241"/>&#13;
      <p>At the day’s end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland, and they&#13;
         went up along its banks while the light lasted. It was already night when at last they halted and made their camp under some&#13;
         stunted alder-trees by the shores of the stream. Ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless backs&#13;
         of the hills. That night they set a watch, and Strider, it seemed, did not sleep at all. The moon was waxing, and in the early&#13;
         night-hours a cold grey light lay on the land.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Next morning they set out again soon after sunrise. There was a frost in the air, and the sky was a pale clear blue. The hobbits&#13;
         felt refreshed, as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep. Already they were getting used to much walking on short commons&#13;
         – shorter at any rate than what in the Shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs. Pippin declared&#13;
         that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very odd,’ said Frodo, tightening his belt, ‘considering that there is actually a good deal less of me. I hope the thinning&#13;
         process will not go on indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do not speak of such things!’ said Strider quickly, and with surprising earnestness.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The hills drew nearer. They made an undulating ridge, often rising almost to a thousand feet, and here and there falling again&#13;
         to low clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond. Along the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see what looked&#13;
         to be the remains of green-grown walls and dikes, and in the clefts there still stood the ruins of old works of stone. By&#13;
         night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes, and there they camped. It was the night of the fifth of October, and&#13;
         they were six days out from Bree.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In the morning they found, for the first time since they had left the Chetwood, a track plain to see. They turned right and&#13;
         followed it southwards. It ran cunningly, taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep as much hidden as possible &#13;
         <a id="page242"/>from the view, both of the hill-tops above and of the flats to the west. It dived into dells, and hugged steep banks; and&#13;
         where it passed over flatter and more open ground on either side of it there were lines of large boulders and hewn stones&#13;
         that screened the travellers almost like a hedge.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wonder who made this path, and what for,’ said Merry, as they walked along one of these avenues, where the stones were&#13;
         unusually large and closely set. ‘I am not sure that I like it: it has a – well, rather a barrow-wightish look. Is there any&#13;
         barrow on Weathertop?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No. There is no barrow on Weathertop, nor on any of these hills,’ answered Strider. ‘The Men of the West did not live here;&#13;
         though in their latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came out of Angmar. This path was made&#13;
         to serve the forts along the walls. But long before, in the first days of the North Kingdom, they built a great watch-tower&#13;
         on Weathertop, Amon Sûl they called it. It was burned and broken, and nothing remains of it now but a tumbled ring, like a&#13;
         rough crown on the old hill’s head. Yet once it was tall and fair. It is told that Elendil stood there watching for the coming&#13;
         of Gil-galad out of the West, in the days of the Last Alliance.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits gazed at Strider. It seemed that he was learned in old lore, as well as in the ways of the wild. ‘Who was Gil-galad?’&#13;
         asked Merry; but Strider did not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought. Suddenly a low voice murmured:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Gil-galad was an Elven-king.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Of him the harpers sadly sing:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>the last whose realm was fair and free</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>between the Mountains and the Sea.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>His sword was long, his lance was keen,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>his shining helm afar was seen;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>the countless stars of heaven’s field</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>were mirrored in his silver shield.</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page243"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>But long ago he rode away,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>and where he dwelleth none can say;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>for into darkness fell his star</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>in Mordor where the shadows are.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>The others turned in amazement, for the voice was Sam’s.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Don’t stop!’ said Merry.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That’s all I know,’ stammered Sam, blushing. ‘I learned it from Mr. Bilbo when I was a lad. He used to tell me tales like&#13;
         that, knowing how I was always one for hearing about Elves. It was Mr. Bilbo as taught me my letters. He was mighty book-learned&#13;
         was dear old Mr. Bilbo. And he wrote <em>poetry</em>. He wrote what I have just said.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He did not make it up,’ said Strider. ‘It is part of the lay that is called <em>The Fall of Gil-galad</em>, which is in an ancient tongue. Bilbo must have translated it. I never knew that.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There was a lot more,’ said Sam, ‘all about Mordor. I didn’t learn that part, it gave me the shivers. I never thought I should&#13;
         be going that way myself!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Going to Mordor!’ cried Pippin. ‘I hope it won’t come to that!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do not speak that name so loudly!’ said Strider.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">It was already mid-day when they drew near the southern end of the path, and saw before them, in the pale clear light of the&#13;
         October sun, a grey-green bank, leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of the hill. They decided to make for the&#13;
         top at once, while the daylight was broad. Concealment was no longer possible, and they could only hope that no enemy or spy&#13;
         was observing them. Nothing was to be seen moving on the hill. If Gandalf was anywhere about, there was no sign of him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>On the western flank of Weathertop they found a sheltered hollow, at the bottom of which there was a bowl-shaped dell with&#13;
         grassy sides. There they left Sam and Pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage. The other three went on. After half&#13;
         an hour’s plodding climb Strider reached the crown &#13;
         <a id="page244"/>of the hill; Frodo and Merry followed, tired and breathless. The last slope had been steep and rocky.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>On the top they found, as Strider had said, a wide ring of ancient stone-work, now crumbling or covered with age-long grass.&#13;
         But in the centre a cairn of broken stones had been piled. They were blackened as if with fire. About them the turf was burned&#13;
         to the roots and all within the ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled, as if flames had swept the hilltop; but there&#13;
         was no sign of any living thing.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Standing upon the rim of the ruined circle, they saw all round below them a wide prospect, for the most part of lands empty&#13;
         and featureless, except for patches of woodland away to the south, beyond which they caught here and there the glint of distant&#13;
         water. Beneath them on this southern side there ran like a ribbon the Old Road, coming out of the West and winding up and&#13;
         down, until it faded behind a ridge of dark land to the east. Nothing was moving on it. Following its line eastward with their&#13;
         eyes they saw the Mountains: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre; behind them stood taller shapes of grey, and behind&#13;
         those again were high white peaks glimmering among the clouds.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, here we are!’ said Merry. ‘And very cheerless and uninviting it looks! There is no water and no shelter. And no sign&#13;
         of Gandalf. But I don’t blame him for not waiting – if he ever came here.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wonder,’ said Strider, looking round thoughtfully. ‘Even if he was a day or two behind us at Bree, he could have arrived&#13;
         here first. He can ride very swiftly when need presses.’ Suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on the top of the cairn;&#13;
         it was flatter than the others, and whiter, as if it had escaped the fire. He picked it up and examined it, turning it in&#13;
         his fingers. ‘This has been handled recently,’ he said. ‘What do you think of these marks?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>On the flat under-side Frodo saw some scratches: <img alt="art" src="images/Art_P244.jpg"/> ‘There seems to be a stroke, a dot, and three more strokes,’ he said.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The stroke on the left might be a G-rune with thin &#13;
         <a id="page245"/>branches,’ said Strider. ‘It might be a sign left by Gandalf, though one cannot be sure. The scratches are fine, and they&#13;
         certainly look fresh. But the marks might mean something quite different, and have nothing to do with us. Rangers use runes,&#13;
         and they come here sometimes.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What could they mean, even if Gandalf made them?’ asked Merry.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I should say,’ answered Strider, ‘that they stood for G3, and were a sign that Gandalf was here on October the third: that&#13;
         is three days ago now. It would also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he had no time or did not&#13;
         dare to write anything longer or plainer. If that is so, we must be wary.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wish we could feel sure that he made the marks, whatever they may mean,’ said Frodo. ‘It would be a great comfort to know&#13;
         that he was on the way, in front of us or behind us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Perhaps,’ said Strider. ‘For myself, I believe that he was here, and was in danger. There have been scorching flames here;&#13;
         and now the light that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind. I guess that he was attacked on this&#13;
         hill-top, but with what result I cannot tell. He is here no longer, and we must now look after ourselves and make our own&#13;
         way to Rivendell, as best we can.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘How far is Rivendell?’ asked Merry, gazing round wearily. The world looked wild and wide from Weathertop.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know if the Road has ever been measured in miles beyond the <em>Forsaken Inn</em>, a day’s journey east of Bree,’ answered Strider. ‘Some say it is so far, and some say otherwise. It is a strange road, and&#13;
         folk are glad to reach their journey’s end, whether the time is long or short. But I know how long it would take me on my&#13;
         own feet, with fair weather and no ill fortune: twelve days from here to the Ford of Bruinen, where the Road crosses the Loudwater&#13;
         that runs out of Rivendell. We have at least a fortnight’s journey before us, for I do not think we shall be able to use the&#13;
         Road.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘A fortnight!’ said Frodo. ‘A lot may happen in that time.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It may,’ said Strider.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page246"/>&#13;
      <p>They stood for a while silent on the hill-top, near its southward edge. In that lonely place Frodo for the first time fully&#13;
         realized his homelessness and danger. He wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in the quiet and beloved Shire. He&#13;
         stared down at the hateful Road, leading back westward – to his home. Suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving&#13;
         slowly along it, going westward; and looking again he saw that three others were creeping eastward to meet them. He gave a&#13;
         cry and clutched Strider’s arm.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Look,’ he said, pointing downwards.</p>&#13;
      <p>At once Strider flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle, pulling Frodo down beside him. Merry threw himself alongside.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘What is it?’ he whispered.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not know, but I fear the worst,’ answered Strider. Slowly they crawled up to the edge of the ring again, and peered&#13;
         through a cleft between two jagged stones. The light was no longer bright, for the clear morning had faded, and clouds creeping&#13;
         out of the East had now overtaken the sun, as it began to go down. They could all see the black specks, but neither Frodo&#13;
         nor Merry could make out their shapes for certain; yet something told them that there, far below, were Black Riders assembling&#13;
         on the Road beyond the foot of the hill.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Strider, whose keener sight left him in no doubt. ‘The enemy is here!’</p>&#13;
      <p>Hastily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find their companions.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Sam and Peregrin had not been idle. They had explored the small dell and the surrounding slopes. Not far away they found a&#13;
         spring of clear water in the hillside, and near it footprints not more than a day or two old. In the dell itself they found&#13;
         recent traces of a fire, and other signs of a hasty camp. There were some fallen rocks on the edge of the dell nearest to&#13;
         the hill. Behind them Sam came upon a small store of firewood neatly stacked.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page247"/>&#13;
      <p>‘I wonder if old Gandalf has been here,’ he said to Pippin. ‘Whoever it was put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Strider was greatly interested in these discoveries. ‘I wish I had waited and explored the ground down here myself,’ he said,&#13;
         hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprints.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is just as I feared,’ he said, when he came back. ‘Sam and Pippin have trampled the soft ground, and the marks are spoilt&#13;
         or confused. Rangers have been here lately. It is they who left the firewood behind. But there are also several newer tracks&#13;
         that were not made by Rangers. At least one set was made, only a day or two ago, by heavy boots. At least one. I cannot now&#13;
         be certain, but I think there were many booted feet.’ He paused and stood in anxious thought.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted Riders. If the horsemen had already found the dell,&#13;
         the sooner Strider led them somewhere else the better. Sam viewed the hollow with great dislike, now that he had heard news&#13;
         of their enemies on the Road, only a few miles away.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hadn’t we better clear out quick, Mr. Strider?’ he asked impatiently. ‘It is getting late, and I don’t like this hole: it&#13;
         makes my heart sink somehow.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, we certainly must decide what to do at once,’ answered Strider, looking up and considering the time and the weather.&#13;
         ‘Well, Sam,’ he said at last, ‘I do not like this place either; but I cannot think of anywhere better that we could reach&#13;
         before nightfall. At least we are out of sight for the moment, and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by&#13;
         spies. All we could do would be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hills, where the land is&#13;
         all much the same as it is here. The Road is watched, but we should have to cross it, if we tried to take cover in the thickets&#13;
         away to the south. On the north side of the Road beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Can the Riders <em>see</em>?’ asked Merry. ‘I mean, they seem usually to have used their noses rather than their eyes, &#13;
         <a id="page248"/>smelling for us, if smelling is the right word, at least in the daylight. But you made us lie down flat when you saw them&#13;
         down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I was too careless on the hill-top,’ answered Strider. ‘I was very anxious to find some sign of Gandalf; but it was a mistake&#13;
         for three of us to go up and stand there so long. For the black horses can see, and the Riders can use men and other creatures&#13;
         as spies, as we found at Bree. They themselves do not see the world of light as we do, but our shapes cast shadows in their&#13;
         minds, which only the noon sun destroys; and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us: then&#13;
         they are most to be feared. And at all times they smell the blood of living things, desiring and hating it. Senses, too, there&#13;
         are other than sight or smell. We can feel their presence – it troubled our hearts, as soon as we came here, and before we&#13;
         saw them; they feel ours more keenly. Also,’ he added, and his voice sank to a whisper, ‘the Ring draws them.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Is there no escape then?’ said Frodo, looking round wildly. ‘If I move I shall be seen and hunted! If I stay, I shall draw&#13;
         them to me!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Strider laid his hand on his shoulder. ‘There is still hope,’ he said. ‘You are not alone. Let us take this wood that is set&#13;
         ready for the fire as a sign. There is little shelter or defence here, but fire shall serve for both. Sauron can put fire&#13;
         to his evil uses, as he can all things, but these Riders do not love it, and fear those who wield it. Fire is our friend in&#13;
         the wilderness.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Maybe,’ muttered Sam. ‘It is also as good a way of saying “here we are” as I can think of, bar shouting.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the dell they lit a fire, and prepared a meal. The shades of evening began&#13;
         to fall, and it grew cold. They were suddenly aware of great hunger, for they had not eaten anything since breakfast; but&#13;
         they dared not make more than a frugal supper. The lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts, unfriendly places&#13;
         deserted by all the races of the world.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page249"/>&#13;
      <p>Rangers passed at times beyond the hills, but they were few and did not stay. Other wanderers were rare, and of evil sort:&#13;
         trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the Misty Mountains. Only on the Road would travellers be&#13;
         found, most often dwarves, hurrying along on business of their own, and with no help and few words to spare for strangers.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t see how our food can be made to last,’ said Frodo. ‘We have been careful enough in the last few days, and this supper&#13;
         is no feast; but we have used more than we ought, if we have two weeks still to go, and perhaps more.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is food in the wild,’ said Strider; ‘berry, root, and herb; and I have some skill as a hunter at need. You need not&#13;
         be afraid of starving before winter comes. But gathering and catching food is long and weary work, and we need haste. So tighten&#13;
         your belts, and think with hope of the tables of Elrond’s house!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The cold increased as darkness came on. Peering out from the edge of the dell they could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing&#13;
         quickly into shadow. The sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars. Frodo and his companions&#13;
         huddled round the fire, wrapped in every garment and blanket they possessed; but Strider was content with a single cloak,&#13;
         and sat a little apart, drawing thoughtfully at his pipe.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brightly he began to tell them tales to keep their minds from fear.&#13;
         He knew many histories and legends of long ago, of Elves and Men and the good and evil deeds of the Elder Days. They wondered&#13;
         how old he was, and where he had learned all this lore.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Tell us of Gil-galad,’ said Merry suddenly, when he paused at the end of a story of the Elf-kingdoms. ‘Do you know any more&#13;
         of that old lay that you spoke of?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do indeed,’ answered Strider. ‘So also does Frodo, for it concerns us closely.’ Merry and Pippin looked at Frodo, who was&#13;
         staring into the fire.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page250"/>&#13;
      <p>‘I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,’ said Frodo slowly. ‘Gil-galad was the last of the great Elf-kings of Middle-earth.&#13;
         Gil-galad is <em>Starlight</em> in their tongue. With Elendil, the Elf-friend, he went to the land of——’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No!’ said Strider interrupting, ‘I do not think that tale should be told now with the servants of the Enemy at hand. If we&#13;
         win through to the house of Elrond, you may hear it there, told in full.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then tell us some other tale of the old days,’ begged Sam; ‘a tale about the Elves before the fading time. I would dearly&#13;
         like to hear more about Elves; the dark seems to press round so close.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will tell you the tale of Tinúviel,’ said Strider, ‘in brief – for it is a long tale of which the end is not known; and&#13;
         there are none now, except Elrond, that remember it aright as it was told of old. It is a fair tale, though it is sad, as&#13;
         are all the tales of Middle-earth, and yet it may lift up your hearts.’ He was silent for some time, and then he began not&#13;
         to speak but to chant softly:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>The leaves were long, the grass was green,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And in the glade a light was seen</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Of stars in shadow shimmering.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Tinúviel was dancing there</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>To music of a pipe unseen,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And light of stars was in her hair,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>And in her raiment glimmering.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>There Beren came from mountains cold,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>And lost he wandered under leaves,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And where the Elven-river rolled</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>He walked alone and sorrowing.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>He peered between the hemlock-leaves</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>And saw in wonder flowers of gold</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Upon her mantle and her sleeves,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>And her hair like shadow following.</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page251"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Enchantment healed his weary feet</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>That over hills were doomed to roam;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And forth he hastened, strong and fleet,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>And grasped at moonbeams glistening.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Through woven woods in Elvenhome</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>She lightly fled on dancing feet,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And left him lonely still to roam</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>In the silent forest listening.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>He heard there oft the flying sound</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Of feet as light as linden-leaves,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Or music welling underground,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>In hidden hollows quavering.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>And one by one with sighing sound</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Whispering fell the beechen leaves</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>In the wintry woodland wavering.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>He sought her ever, wandering far</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Where leaves of years were thickly strewn,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>By light of moon and ray of star</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>In frosty heavens shivering.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Her mantle glinted in the moon,</em></p>&#13;
 <p class="vex-t"><em>As on a hill-top high and far</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>She danced, and at her feet was strewn</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>A mist of silver quivering.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>When winter passed, she came again,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>And her song released the sudden spring,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Like rising lark, and falling rain,</em></p>&#13;
 <p class="vex-t"><em>And melting water bubbling.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>He saw the elven-flowers spring</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>About her feet, and healed again</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>He longed by her to dance and sing</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>Upon the grass untroubling.</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page252"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Again she fled, but swift he came.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Tinúviel! Tinúviel!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>He called her by her Elvish name;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>And there she halted listening.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>One moment stood she, and a spell</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>His voice laid on her: Beren came,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And doom fell on Tinúviel</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>That in his arms lay glistening.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>As Beren looked into her eyes</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Within the shadows of her hair,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>The trembling starlight of the skies</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>He saw there mirrored shimmering.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Tinúviel the elven-fair,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Immortal maiden elven-wise,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>About him cast her shadowy hair</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>And arms like silver glimmering.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Long was the way that fate them bore,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>O’er stony mountains cold and grey,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Through halls of iron and darkling door,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>And woods of nightshade morrowless.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>The Sundering Seas between them lay,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>And yet at last they met once more,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And long ago they passed away</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>In the forest singing sorrowless.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>Strider sighed and paused before he spoke again. ‘That is a song,’ he said, ‘in the mode that is called <em>ann-thennath</em> among the Elves, but is hard to render in our Common Speech, and this is but a rough echo of it. It tells of the meeting&#13;
         of Beren son of Barahir and Lúthien Tinúviel. Beren was a mortal man, but Lúthien was the daughter of Thingol, a King of Elves&#13;
         upon Middle-earth when the world was young; and she was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all the children of this&#13;
         world. As the stars above the mists of the Northern lands was her loveliness, and in her &#13;
         <a id="page253"/>face was a shining light. In those days the Great Enemy, of whom Sauron of Mordor was but a servant, dwelt in Angband in the&#13;
         North, and the Elves of the West coming back to Middle-earth made war upon him to regain the Silmarils which he had stolen;&#13;
         and the fathers of Men aided the Elves. But the Enemy was victorious and Barahir was slain, and Beren escaping through great&#13;
         peril came over the Mountains of Terror into the hidden Kingdom of Thingol in the forest of Neldoreth. There he beheld Lúthien&#13;
         singing and dancing in a glade beside the enchanted river Esgalduin; and he named her Tinúviel, that is Nightingale in the&#13;
         language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and they were parted long. Tinúviel rescued Beren from the dungeons&#13;
         of Sauron, and together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great Enemy from his throne, and took from&#13;
         his iron crown one of the three Silmarils, brightest of all jewels, to be the bride-price of Lúthien to Thingol her father.&#13;
         Yet at the last Beren was slain by the Wolf that came from the gates of Angband, and he died in the arms of Tinúviel. But&#13;
         she chose mortality, and to die from the world, so that she might follow him; and it is sung that they met again beyond the&#13;
         Sundering Seas, and after a brief time walking alive once more in the green woods, together they passed, long ago, beyond&#13;
         the confines of this world. So it is that Lúthien Tinúviel alone of the Elf-kindred has died indeed and left the world, and&#13;
         they have lost her whom they most loved. But from her the lineage of the Elf-lords of old descended among Men. There live&#13;
         still those of whom Lúthien was the foremother, and it is said that her line shall never fail. Elrond of Rivendell is of that&#13;
         Kin. For of Beren and Lúthien was born Dior Thingol’s heir; and of him Elwing the White whom Eärendil wedded, he that sailed&#13;
         his ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the Silmaril upon his brow. And of Eärendil came the&#13;
         Kings of Númenor, that is Westernesse.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As Strider was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit in the red glow of the wood-fire. His eyes &#13;
         <a id="page254"/>shone, and his voice was rich and deep. Above him was a black starry sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of&#13;
         Weathertop behind him. The waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed them, and the stars above the&#13;
         hill-top faded.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The story ended. The hobbits moved and stretched. ‘Look!’ said Merry. ‘The Moon is rising: it must be getting late.’</p>&#13;
      <p>The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of&#13;
         the moonrise. It was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock shown up by the pale light.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam and Merry got up and walked away from the fire. Frodo and Pippin remained seated in silence. Strider was watching the&#13;
         moonlight on the hill intently. All seemed quiet and still, but Frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart, now that&#13;
         Strider was no longer speaking. He huddled closer to the fire. At that moment Sam came running back from the edge of the dell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know what it is,’ he said, ‘but I suddenly felt afraid. I durstn’t go outside this dell for any money; I felt that&#13;
         something was creeping up the slope.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Did you <em>see</em> anything?’ asked Frodo, springing to his feet.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, sir. I saw nothing, but I didn’t stop to look.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I saw something,’ said Merry; ‘or I thought I did – away westwards where the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the&#13;
         shadow of the hill-tops, I <em>thought</em> there were two or three black shapes. They seemed to be moving this way.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Keep close to the fire, with your faces outward!’ cried Strider. ‘Get some of the longer sticks ready in your hands!’</p>&#13;
      <p>For a breathless time they sat there, silent and alert, with their backs turned to the wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows&#13;
         that encircled them. Nothing happened. There was no sound or movement in the night. Frodo stirred, feeling that he must break&#13;
         the silence: he longed to shout out aloud.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hush!’ whispered Strider. ‘What’s that?’ gasped Pippin at the same moment.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page255"/>&#13;
      <p>Over the lip of the little dell, on the side away from the hill, they felt, rather than saw, a shadow rise, one shadow or&#13;
         more than one. They strained their eyes, and the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no doubt: three or four tall&#13;
         black figures were standing there on the slope, looking down on them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes&#13;
         in the deep shade behind them. Frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill.&#13;
         Then the shapes slowly advanced.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Terror overcame Pippin and Merry, and they threw themselves flat on the ground. Sam shrank to Frodo’s side. Frodo was hardly&#13;
         less terrified than his companions; he was quaking as if he was bitter cold, but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation&#13;
         to put on the Ring. The desire to do this laid hold of him, and he could think of nothing else. He did not forget the Barrow,&#13;
         nor the message of Gandalf; but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to yield. Not&#13;
         with the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he simply felt that he must take the Ring and put it on&#13;
         his finger. He could not speak. He felt Sam looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble, but he&#13;
         could not turn towards him. He shut his eyes and struggled for a while; but resistance became unbearable, and at last he slowly&#13;
         drew out the chain, and slipped the Ring on the forefinger of his left hand.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, the shapes became terribly clear. He was able to see&#13;
         beneath their black wrappings. There were five tall figures: two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing. In their&#13;
         white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs were helms of&#13;
         silver; in their haggard hands were swords of steel. Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him. Desperate,&#13;
         he drew his own sword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a firebrand. Two of the figures halted. The&#13;
         third was taller than the others: &#13;
         <a id="page256"/>his hair was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown. In one hand he held a long sword, and in the other a knife; both&#13;
         the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down on Frodo.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At that moment Frodo threw himself forward on the ground, and he heard himself crying aloud: <em>O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!</em> At the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy. A shrill cry rang out in the night; and he felt a pain like a dart of&#13;
         poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder. Even as he swooned he caught, as through a swirling mist, a glimpse of Strider leaping&#13;
         out of the darkness with a flaming brand of wood in either hand. With a last effort Frodo, dropping his sword, slipped the&#13;
         Ring from his finger and closed his right hand tight upon it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-12">FLIGHT TO THE FORD</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">When Frodo came to himself he was still clutching the Ring desperately. He was lying by the fire, which was now piled high&#13;
         and burning brightly. His three companions were bending over him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What has happened? Where is the pale king?’ he asked wildly.</p>&#13;
      <p>They were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while; nor did they understand his question. At length he gathered&#13;
         from Sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them. Suddenly to his horror Sam found that&#13;
         his master had vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him, and he fell. He heard Frodo’s voice, but it seemed&#13;
         to come from a great distance, or from under the earth, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more, until they stumbled&#13;
         over the body of Frodo, lying as if dead, face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him. Strider ordered them to&#13;
         pick him up and lay him near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now a good while ago.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about Strider; but while they were talking he returned, appearing suddenly&#13;
         out of the shadows. They started, and Sam drew his sword and stood over Frodo; but Strider knelt down swiftly at his side.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am not a Black Rider, Sam,’ he said gently, ‘nor in league with them. I have been trying to discover something of their&#13;
         movements; but I have found nothing. I cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again. But there is no feeling of&#13;
         their presence anywhere at hand.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When he heard what Frodo had to tell, he became full of &#13;
         <a id="page258"/>concern, and shook his head and sighed. Then he ordered Pippin and Merry to heat as much water as they could in their small&#13;
         kettles, and to bathe the wound with it. ‘Keep the fire going well, and keep Frodo warm!’ he said. Then he got up and walked&#13;
         away, and called Sam to him. ‘I think I understand things better now,’ he said in a low voice. ‘There seem only to have been&#13;
         five of the enemy. Why they were not all here, I don’t know; but I don’t think they expected to be resisted. They have drawn&#13;
         off for the time being. But not far, I fear. They will come again another night, if we cannot escape. They are only waiting,&#13;
         because they think that their purpose is almost accomplished, and that the Ring cannot fly much further. I fear, Sam, that&#13;
         they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him to their will. We shall see!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam choked with tears. ‘Don’t despair!’ said Strider. ‘You must trust me now. Your Frodo is made of sterner stuff than I had&#13;
         guessed, though Gandalf hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and I think he will resist the evil power of the wound&#13;
         longer than his enemies expect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. Guard him well, while I am away!’ He hurried off&#13;
         and disappeared again into the darkness.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Frodo dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a deadly chill was spreading from his shoulder to his arm&#13;
         and side. His friends watched over him, warming him, and bathing his wound. The night passed slowly and wearily. Dawn was&#13;
         growing in the sky, and the dell was filling with grey light, when Strider at last returned.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Look!’ he cried; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot&#13;
         above the lower hem there was a slash. ‘This was the stroke of Frodo’s sword,’ he said. ‘The only hurt that it did to his&#13;
         enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades perish that pierce that dreadful King. More deadly to him was the name of&#13;
         Elbereth.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And more deadly to Frodo was this!’ He stooped again &#13;
         <a id="page259"/>and lifted up a long thin knife. There was a cold gleam in it. As Strider raised it they saw that near the end its edge was&#13;
         notched and the point was broken off. But even as he held it up in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for the&#13;
         blade seemed to melt, and vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only the hilt in Strider’s hand. ‘Alas!’ he cried. ‘It&#13;
         was this accursed knife that gave the wound. Few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons. But I will do what&#13;
         I can.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger-hilt laid it on his knees, and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue.&#13;
         Then setting it aside, he turned to Frodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch. From the pouch at his&#13;
         belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘These leaves,’ he said, ‘I have walked far to find; for this plant does not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away&#13;
         south of the Road I found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.’ He crushed a leaf in his fingers, and it gave out a&#13;
         sweet and pungent fragrance. ‘It is fortunate that I could find it, for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West brought&#13;
         to Middle-earth. <em>Athelas</em> they named it, and it grows now sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or camped of old; and it is not known in the&#13;
         North, except to some of those who wander in the Wild. It has great virtues, but over such a wound as this its healing powers&#13;
         may be small.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed Frodo’s shoulder. The fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and those that&#13;
         were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared. The herb had also some power over the wound, for Frodo felt the pain and&#13;
         also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side; but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not raise or use his&#13;
         hand. He bitterly regretted his foolishness, and reproached himself for weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting&#13;
         on the Ring he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He wondered if he would remain maimed for&#13;
         life, and how they &#13;
         <a id="page260"/>would now manage to continue their journey. He felt too weak to stand.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The others were discussing this very question. They quickly decided to leave Weathertop as soon as possible. ‘I think now,’&#13;
         said Strider, ‘that the enemy has been watching this place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here, then he must have been&#13;
         forced to ride away, and he will not return. In any case we are in great peril here after dark, since the attack of last night,&#13;
         and we can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried food and packed. It was impossible for Frodo to walk, so they divided&#13;
         the greater part of their baggage among the four of them, and put Frodo on the pony. In the last few days the poor beast had&#13;
         improved wonderfully; it already seemed fatter and stronger, and had begun to show an affection for its new masters, especially&#13;
         for Sam. Bill Ferny’s treatment must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its former&#13;
         life.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing the Road, but it was the quickest way to more wooded country.&#13;
         And they needed fuel; for Strider said that Frodo must be kept warm, especially at night, while fire would be some protection&#13;
         for them all. It was also his plan to shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop of the Road: east beyond&#13;
         Weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western slopes of the hill, and came in a little while to the edge&#13;
         of the Road. There was no sign of the Riders. But even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries: a cold&#13;
         voice calling and a cold voice answering. Trembling they sprang forward, and made for the thickets that lay ahead. The land&#13;
         before them sloped away southwards, but it was wild and pathless; bushes and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide&#13;
         barren spaces in between. The grass was &#13;
         <a id="page261"/>scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling. It was a cheerless land, and their journey&#13;
         was slow and gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. Frodo’s heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside&#13;
         him with their heads down, and their backs bowed under their burdens. Even Strider seemed tired and heavy-hearted.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Before the first day’s march was over Frodo’s pain began to grow again, but he did not speak of it for a long time. Four days&#13;
         passed, without the ground or the scene changing much, except that behind them Weathertop slowly sank, and before them the&#13;
         distant mountains loomed a little nearer. Yet since that far cry they had seen and heard no sign that the enemy had marked&#13;
         their flight or followed them. They dreaded the dark hours, and kept watch in pairs by night, expecting at any time to see&#13;
         black shapes stalking in the grey night, dimly lit by the cloud-veiled moon; but they saw nothing, and heard no sound but&#13;
         the sigh of withered leaves and grass. Not once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the&#13;
         attack in the dell. It seemed too much to hope that the Riders had already lost their trail again. Perhaps they were waiting&#13;
         to make some ambush in a narrow place?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended.&#13;
         Strider now turned their course again north-eastwards, and on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slow-climbing slope,&#13;
         and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills. Away below them they could see the Road sweeping round the feet of the hills;&#13;
         and to their right a grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine. In the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony&#13;
         valley half-veiled in mist.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am afraid we must go back to the Road here for a while,’ said Strider. ‘We have now come to the River Hoarwell, that the&#13;
         Elves call Mitheithel. It flows down out of the Ettenmoors, the troll-fells north of Rivendell, and joins the Loudwater &#13;
         <a id="page262"/>away in the South. Some call it the Greyflood after that. It is a great water before it finds the Sea. There is no way over&#13;
         it below its sources in the Ettenmoors, except by the Last Bridge on which the Road crosses.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What is that other river we can see far away there?’ asked Merry.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is Loudwater, the Bruinen of Rivendell,’ answered Strider. ‘The Road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles&#13;
         from the Bridge to the Ford of Bruinen. But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water. One river at a time! We&#13;
         shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last Bridge held against us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Next day, early in the morning, they came down again to the borders of the Road. Sam and Strider went forward, but they found&#13;
         no sign of any travellers or riders. Here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain. Strider judged that it had&#13;
         fallen two days before, and had washed away all footprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he could see.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They hurried along with all the speed they could make, and after a mile or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at the bottom&#13;
         of a short steep slope. They dreaded to see black figures waiting there, but they saw none. Strider made them take cover in&#13;
         a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went forward to explore.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Before long he came hurrying back. ‘I can see no sign of the enemy,’ he said, ‘and I wonder very much what that means. But&#13;
         I have found something very strange.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. ‘I found it in the mud in the middle of the Bridge,’ he said.&#13;
         ‘It is a beryl, an elf-stone. Whether it was set there, or let fall by chance, I cannot say; but it brings hope to me. I will&#13;
         take it as a sign that we may pass the Bridge; but beyond that I dare not keep to the Road, without some clearer token.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page263"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At once they went on again. They crossed the Bridge in safety, hearing no sound but the water swirling against its three great&#13;
         arches. A mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the&#13;
         Road. Here Strider turned aside, and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen&#13;
         hills.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous Road behind them; but this new country seemed threatening&#13;
         and unfriendly. As they went forward the hills about them steadily rose. Here and there upon heights and ridges they caught&#13;
         glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the ruins of towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo, who was not walking, had time&#13;
         to gaze ahead and to think. He recalled Bilbo’s account of his journey and the threatening towers on the hills north of the&#13;
         Road, in the country near the Trolls’ wood where his first serious adventure had happened. Frodo guessed that they were now&#13;
         in the same region, and wondered if by chance they would pass near the spot.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who lives in this land?’ he asked. ‘And who built these towers? Is this troll-country?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No!’ said Strider. ‘Trolls do not build. No one lives in this land. Men once dwelt here, ages ago; but none remain now. They&#13;
         became an evil people, as legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of Angmar. But all were destroyed in the war that brought&#13;
         the North Kingdom to its end. But that is now so long ago that the hills have forgotten them, though a shadow still lies on&#13;
         the land.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and forgetful?’ asked Peregrin. ‘The birds and beasts do not tell&#13;
         tales of that sort.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past,’ said Strider; ‘and many more things than I can tell are remembered in&#13;
         Rivendell.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Have you often been to Rivendell?’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have,’ said Strider. ‘I dwelt there once, and still I return &#13;
         <a id="page264"/>when I may. There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the fair house of Elrond.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The hills now began to shut them in. The Road behind held on its way to the River Bruinen, but both were now hidden from view.&#13;
         The travellers came into a long valley; narrow, deeply cloven, dark and silent. Trees with old and twisted roots hung over&#13;
         cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine-wood.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had to pick their way through a pathless country, encumbered by&#13;
         fallen trees and tumbled rocks. As long as they could they avoided climbing for Frodo’s sake, and because it was in fact difficult&#13;
         to find any way up out of the narrow dales. They had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet. The wind began&#13;
         to blow steadily out of the West and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain.&#13;
         By nightfall they were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for they could not get any fire to burn. The next day the&#13;
         hills rose still higher and steeper before them, and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their course. Strider&#13;
         seemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly ten days out from Weathertop, and their stock of provisions was beginning to&#13;
         run low. It went on raining.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>That night they camped on a stony shelf with a rock-wall behind them, in which there was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the&#13;
         cliff. Frodo was restless. The cold and wet had made his wound more painful than ever, and the ache and sense of deadly chill&#13;
         took away all sleep. He lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night-noises: wind in chinks of rock,&#13;
         water dripping, a crack, the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone. He felt that black shapes were advancing to smother&#13;
         him; but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of Strider sitting hunched up, smoking his pipe, and watching. He lay&#13;
         down again and passed into an uneasy dream, in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page265"/>&#13;
      <p>Shire, but it seemed faint and dim, less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">In the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped. The clouds were still thick, but they were breaking, and pale strips&#13;
         of blue appeared between them. The wind was shifting again. They did not start early. Immediately after their cold and comfortless&#13;
         breakfast Strider went off alone, telling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he came back. He was&#13;
         going to climb up, if he could, and get a look at the lie of the land.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When he returned he was not reassuring. ‘We have come too far to the north,’ he said, ‘and we must find some way to turn back&#13;
         southwards again. If we keep on as we are going we shall get up into the Ettendales far north of Rivendell. That is troll-country,&#13;
         and little known to me. We could perhaps find our way through and come round to Rivendell from the north; but it would take&#13;
         too long, for I do not know the way, and our food would not last. So somehow or other we must find the Ford of Bruinen.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground. They found a passage between two hills that led them into a&#13;
         valley running south-east, the direction that they wished to take; but towards the end of the day they found their road again&#13;
         barred by a ridge of high land; its dark edge against the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw.&#13;
         They had a choice between going back or climbing over it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult. Before long Frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along&#13;
         on foot. Even so they often despaired of getting their pony up, or indeed of finding a path for themselves, burdened as they&#13;
         were. The light was nearly gone, and they were all exhausted, when at last they reached the top. They had climbed on to a&#13;
         narrow saddle between two higher points, and the land fell steeply away again, only a short distance ahead. Frodo threw himself&#13;
         down, and lay on the ground &#13;
         <a id="page266"/>shivering. His left arm was lifeless, and his side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees and rocks&#13;
         about him seemed shadowy and dim.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We cannot go any further,’ said Merry to Strider. ‘I am afraid this has been too much for Frodo. I am dreadfully anxious&#13;
         about him. What are we to do? Do you think they will be able to cure him in Rivendell, if we ever get there?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We shall see,’ answered Strider. ‘There is nothing more that I can do in the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his&#13;
         wound that I am so anxious to press on. But I agree that we can go no further tonight.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What is the matter with my master?’ asked Sam in a low voice, looking appealingly at Strider. ‘His wound was small, and it&#13;
         is already closed. There’s nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,’ said Strider, ‘and there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond&#13;
         my skill to drive out. But do not give up hope, Sam!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Night was cold up on the high ridge. They lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow&#13;
         pit: it looked as if stone had once been quarried there. They sat huddled together. The wind blew chill through the pass,&#13;
         and they heard the tree-tops lower down moaning and sighing. Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining that endless dark wings&#13;
         were sweeping by above him, and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean, and the light pale and clear in a rain-washed sky. Their hearts were&#13;
         encouraged, but they longed for the sun to warm their cold stiff limbs. As soon as it was light, Strider took Merry with him&#13;
         and went to survey the country from the height to the east of the pass. The sun had risen and was shining brightly when he&#13;
         returned with more comforting news. They were now going more or less in the right direction. If they &#13;
         <a id="page267"/>went on, down the further side of the ridge, they would have the Mountains on their left. Some way ahead Strider had caught&#13;
         a glimpse of the Loudwater again, and he knew that, though it was hidden from view, the Road to the Ford was not far from&#13;
         the River and lay on the side nearest to them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We must make for the Road again,’ he said. ‘We cannot hope to find a path through these hills. Whatever danger may beset&#13;
         it, the Road is our only way to the Ford.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">As soon as they had eaten they set out again. They climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge; but the way was much&#13;
         easier than they had expected, for the slope was far less steep on this side, and before long Frodo was able to ride again.&#13;
         Bill Ferny’s poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its rider as many jolts&#13;
         as possible. The spirits of the party rose again. Even Frodo felt better in the morning light, but every now and again a mist&#13;
         seemed to obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin was a little ahead of the others. Suddenly he turned round and called to them. ‘There is a path here!’ he cried.</p>&#13;
      <p>When they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake: there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed&#13;
         with many windings out of the woods below and faded away on the hill-top behind. In places it was now faint and overgrown,&#13;
         or choked with fallen stones and trees; but at one time it seemed to have been much used. It was a path made by strong arms&#13;
         and heavy feet. Here and there old trees had been cut or broken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest way down, but they went cautiously, and their anxiety&#13;
         increased as they came into the dark woods, and the path grew plainer and broader. Suddenly coming out of a belt of fir-trees&#13;
         it ran steeply down a slope, and turned sharply to the left round the corner of a rocky shoulder of the hill.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page268"/>&#13;
      <p>When they came to the corner they looked round and saw that the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff&#13;
         overhung with trees. In the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon one great hinge.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Outside the door they all halted. There was a cave or rock-chamber behind, but in the gloom inside nothing could be seen.&#13;
         Strider, Sam, and Merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door a little wider, and then Strider and Merry&#13;
         went in. They did not go far, for on the floor lay many old bones, and nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except&#13;
         some great empty jars and broken pots.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was one!’ said Pippin. ‘Come out, you two, and let us get away. Now we know who&#13;
         made the path – and we had better get off it quick.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is no need, I think,’ said Strider, coming out. ‘It is certainly a troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken.&#13;
         I don’t think we need be afraid. But let us go on down warily, and we shall see.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The path went on again from the door, and turning to the right again across the level space plunged down a thick wooded slope.&#13;
         Pippin, not liking to show Strider that he was still afraid, went on ahead with Merry. Sam and Strider came behind, one on&#13;
         each side of Frodo’s pony, for the path was now broad enough for four or five hobbits to walk abreast. But they had not gone&#13;
         very far before Pippin came running back, followed by Merry. They both looked terrified.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There <em>are</em> trolls!’ Pippin panted. ‘Down in a clearing in the woods not far below. We got a sight of them through the tree-trunks. They&#13;
         are very large!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We will come and look at them,’ said Strider, picking up a stick. Frodo said nothing, but Sam looked scared.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The sun was now high, and it shone down through the half-stripped branches of the trees, and lit the clearing with bright&#13;
         patches of light. They halted suddenly on the edge, and peered through the tree-trunks, holding their breath.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page269"/>&#13;
      <p>There stood the trolls: three large trolls. One was stooping, and the other two stood staring at him.</p>&#13;
      <p>Strider walked forward unconcernedly. ‘Get up, old stone!’ he said, and broke his stick upon the stooping troll.</p>&#13;
      <p>Nothing happened. There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits, and then even Frodo laughed. ‘Well!’ he said. ‘We are&#13;
         forgetting our family history! These must be the very three that were caught by Gandalf, quarrelling over the right way to&#13;
         cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I had no idea we were anywhere near the place!’ said Pippin. He knew the story well. Bilbo and Frodo had told it often; but&#13;
         as a matter of fact he had never more than half believed it. Even now he looked at the stone trolls with suspicion, wondering&#13;
         if some magic might not suddenly bring them to life again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew about trolls,’ said Strider. ‘It is broad daylight&#13;
         with a bright sun, and yet you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in this glade! In any&#13;
         case you might have noticed that one of them has an old bird’s nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament&#13;
         for a live troll!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They all laughed. Frodo felt his spirits reviving: the reminder of Bilbo’s first successful adventure was heartening. The&#13;
         sun, too, was warm and comforting, and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little. They rested for some time in&#13;
         the glade, and took their mid-day meal right under the shadow of the trolls’ large legs.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Won’t somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?’ said Merry, when they had finished. ‘We haven’t had a song&#13;
         or a tale for days.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not since Weathertop,’ said Frodo. The others looked at him. ‘Don’t worry about me!’ he added. ‘I feel much better, but I&#13;
         don’t think I could sing. Perhaps Sam could dig something out of his memory.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come on, Sam!’ said Merry. ‘There’s more stored in your head than you let on about.’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page270"/>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know about that,’ said Sam. ‘But how would this suit? It ain’t what I call proper poetry, if you understand me: just&#13;
         a bit of nonsense. But these old images here brought it to my mind.’ Standing up, with his hands behind his back, as if he&#13;
         was at school, he began to sing to an old tune.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>For many a year he had gnawed it near,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="ve-xt"><em>For meat was hard to come by.</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>Said he to Troll: ‘Pray, what is yon?</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>For it looks like the shin o’ my nuncle Tim,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="ve-xt"><em>As should be a-lyin’ in graveyard.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="v-ext"><em>Caveyard! Paveyard!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>This many a year has Tim been gone,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="ve-xt"><em>And I thought he were lyin’ in graveyard.’</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>‘My lad,’ said Troll, ‘this bone I stole.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>But what be bones that lie in a hole?</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Thy nuncle was dead as a lump o’ lead,</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext1"><em>‘For a couple o’ pins,’ says Troll, and grins,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>‘I’ll eat thee too, and gnaw thy shins.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>A bit o’ fresh meat will go down sweet!</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>He found his hands had hold of naught.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Before he could mind, Tom slipped behind</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="ve-xt"><em>And gave him the boot to larn him.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="v-ext"><em>Warn him! Darn him!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>A bump o’ the boot on the seat, Tom thought,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="ve-xt"><em>Would be the way to larn him.</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="v-ext"><em>Peel it! Heal it!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Old Troll laughed, when he heard Tom groan,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="ve-xt"><em>And he knew his toes could feel it.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Tom’s leg is game, since home he came,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And his bootless foot is lasting lame;</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="ve-xt"><em>With the bone he boned from its owner.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="v-ext"><em>Doner! Boner!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Troll’s old seat is still the same,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="ve-xt"><em>And the bone he boned from its owner!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘Well, that’s a warning to us all!’ laughed Merry. ‘It is as well you used a stick, and not your hand, Strider!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where did you come by that, Sam?’ asked Pippin. ‘I’ve never heard those words before.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Sam muttered something inaudible. ‘It’s out of his own &#13;
         <a id="page272"/>head, of course,’ said Frodo. ‘I am learning a lot about Sam Gamgee on this journey. First he was a conspirator, now he’s&#13;
         a jester. He’ll end up by becoming a wizard – or a warrior!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I hope not,’ said Sam. ‘I don’t want to be neither!’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">In the afternoon they went on down the woods. They were probably following the very track that Gandalf, Bilbo, and the dwarves&#13;
         had used many years before. After a few miles they came out on the top of a high bank above the Road. At this point the Road&#13;
         had left the Hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley, and now clung close to the feet of the hills, rolling and winding eastward&#13;
         among woods and heather-covered slopes towards the Ford and the Mountains. Not far down the bank Strider pointed out a stone&#13;
         in the grass. On it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen dwarf-runes and secret marks.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There!’ said Merry. ‘That must be the stone that marked the place where the trolls’ gold was hidden. How much is left of&#13;
         Bilbo’s share, I wonder, Frodo?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo looked at the stone, and wished that Bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilous, nor less easy to part with. ‘None&#13;
         at all,’ he said. ‘Bilbo gave it all away. He told me he did not feel it was really his, as it came from robbers.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening. There was no sign of any other travellers to be seen. As there&#13;
         was now no other possible course for them to take, they climbed down the bank, and turning left went off as fast as they could.&#13;
         Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast westering sun. A cold wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains&#13;
         ahead.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They were beginning to look out for a place off the Road, where they could camp for the night, when they heard a sound that&#13;
         brought sudden fear back into their hearts: the noise of hoofs behind them. They looked back, but they could not see far because&#13;
         of the many windings and rollings of the Road. As quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten &#13;
         <a id="page273"/>way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on the slopes above, until they came to a small patch of thick-growing&#13;
         hazels. As they peered out from among the bushes, they could see the Road, faint and grey in the failing light, some thirty&#13;
         feet below them. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. They were going fast, with a light <em>clippety-clippety-clip</em>. Then faintly, as if it was blown away from them by the breeze, they seemed to catch a dim ringing, as of small bells tinkling.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That does not sound like a Black Rider’s horse!’ said Frodo, listening intently. The other hobbits agreed hopefully that&#13;
         it did not, but they all remained full of suspicion. They had been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from behind&#13;
         seemed ominous and unfriendly. But Strider was now leaning forward, stooped to the ground, with a hand to his ear, and a look&#13;
         of joy on his face.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The light faded, and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly. Clearer and nearer now the bells jingled, and <em>clippety-clip</em> came the quick trotting feet. Suddenly into view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly. In the&#13;
         dusk its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it were studded with gems like living stars. The rider’s cloak streamed behind&#13;
         him, and his hood was thrown back; his golden hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed. To Frodo it appeared that a&#13;
         white light was shining through the form and raiment of the rider, as if through a thin veil.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the Road, leaping with a cry through the heather; but even before he had&#13;
         moved or called, the rider had reined in his horse and halted, looking up towards the thicket where they stood. When he saw&#13;
         Strider, he dismounted and ran to meet him calling out: <em>Ai na vedui Dúnadan! Mae govannen!</em> His speech and clear ringing voice left no doubt in their hearts: the rider was of the Elven-folk. No others that dwelt in&#13;
         the wide world had voices so fair to hear. But there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they saw that he&#13;
         was now speaking quickly and urgently to Strider.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Soon Strider beckoned to them, and the hobbits left the &#13;
         <a id="page274"/>bushes and hurried down to the Road. ‘This is Glorfindel, who dwells in the house of Elrond,’ said Strider.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hail, and well met at last!’ said the Elf-lord to Frodo. ‘I was sent from Rivendell to look for you. We feared that you were&#13;
         in danger upon the road.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then Gandalf has reached Rivendell?’ cried Frodo joyfully.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No. He had not when I departed; but that was nine days ago,’ answered Glorfindel. ‘Elrond received news that troubled him.&#13;
         Some of my kindred, journeying in your land beyond the Baranduin,&#13;
         <sup>&#13;
            <a href="Fellowshipofth_foot-1.html#footnote_number_8">*</a>&#13;
         </sup>&#13;
         <a id="footnote_reference_8"/> learned that things were amiss, and sent messages as swiftly as they could. They said that the Nine were abroad, and that&#13;
         you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance, for Gandalf had not returned. There are few even in Rivendell that&#13;
         can ride openly against the Nine; but such as there were, Elrond sent out north, west, and south. It was thought that you&#13;
         might turn far aside to avoid pursuit, and become lost in the Wilderness.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was my lot to take the Road, and I came to the Bridge of Mitheithel, and left a token there, nigh on seven days ago. Three&#13;
         of the servants of Sauron were upon the Bridge, but they withdrew and I pursued them westward. I came also upon two others,&#13;
         but they turned away southward. Since then I have searched for your trail. Two days ago I found it, and followed it over the&#13;
         Bridge; and today I marked where you descended from the hills again. But come! There is no time for further news. Since you&#13;
         are here we must risk the peril of the Road and go. There are five behind us, and when they find your trail upon the Road&#13;
         they will ride after us like the wind. And they are not all. Where the other four may be, I do not know. I fear that we may&#13;
         find the Ford is already held against us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>While Glorfindel was speaking the shades of evening deepened. Frodo felt a great weariness come over him. Ever since the sun&#13;
         began to sink the mist before his eyes had darkened, &#13;
         <a id="page275"/>and he felt that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his friends. Now pain assailed him, and he felt cold. He&#13;
         swayed, clutching at Sam’s arm.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘My master is sick and wounded,’ said Sam angrily. ‘He can’t go on riding after nightfall. He needs rest.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Glorfindel caught Frodo as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently in his arms he looked in his face with grave anxiety.</p>&#13;
      <p>Briefly Strider told of the attack on their camp under Weathertop, and of the deadly knife. He drew out the hilt, which he&#13;
         had kept, and handed it to the Elf. Glorfindel shuddered as he took it, but he looked intently at it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There are evil things written on this hilt,’ he said; ‘though maybe your eyes cannot see them. Keep it, Aragorn, till we&#13;
         reach the house of Elrond! But be wary, and handle it as little as you may! Alas! the wounds of this weapon are beyond my&#13;
         skill to heal. I will do what I can – but all the more do I urge you now to go on without rest.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He searched the wound on Frodo’s shoulder with his fingers, and his face grew graver, as if what he learned disquieted him.&#13;
         But Frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand, and the pain&#13;
         grew easier. The dusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been withdrawn. He saw his friends’ faces&#13;
         more clearly again, and a measure of new hope and strength returned.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You shall ride my horse,’ said Glorfindel. ‘I will shorten the stirrups up to the saddle-skirts, and you must sit as tight&#13;
         as you can. But you need not fear: my horse will not let any rider fall that I command him to bear. His pace is light and&#13;
         smooth; and if danger presses too near, he will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot&#13;
         rival.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, he will not!’ said Frodo. ‘I shall not ride him, if I am to be carried off to Rivendell or anywhere else, leaving my&#13;
         friends behind in danger.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Glorfindel smiled. ‘I doubt very much,’ he said, ‘if your &#13;
         <a id="page276"/>friends would be in danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace, I think. It is you,&#13;
         Frodo, and that which you bear that brings us all in peril.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">To that Frodo had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount Glorfindel’s white horse. The pony was laden instead with a great&#13;
         part of the others’ burdens, so that they now marched lighter, and for a time made good speed; but the hobbits began to find&#13;
         it hard to keep up with the swift tireless feet of the Elf. On he led them, into the mouth of darkness, and still on under&#13;
         the deep clouded night. There was neither star nor moon. Not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt. Pippin, Merry,&#13;
         and Sam were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even Strider seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be&#13;
         weary. Frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the road-side, and fell asleep immediately. They seemed hardly to&#13;
         have closed their eyes when Glorfindel, who had set himself to watch while they slept, awoke them again. The sun had now climbed&#13;
         far into the morning, and the clouds and mists of the night were gone.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Drink this!’ said Glorfindel to them, pouring for each in turn a little liquor from his silver-studded flask of leather.&#13;
         It was clear as spring water and had no taste, and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth; but strength and vigour&#13;
         seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank it. Eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fruit (which was&#13;
         now all that they had left) seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They had rested rather less than five hours when they took to the Road again. Glorfindel still urged them on, and only allowed&#13;
         two brief halts during the day’s march. In this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall, and came to a point&#13;
         where the Road bent right and ran down towards &#13;
         <a id="page277"/>the bottom of the valley, now making straight for the Bruinen. So far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the&#13;
         hobbits could see or hear; but often Glorfindel would halt and listen for a moment, if they lagged behind, and a look of anxiety&#13;
         clouded his face. Once or twice he spoke to Strider in the elf-tongue.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the hobbits could go no further that night. They were stumbling&#13;
         along dizzy with weariness, and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs. Frodo’s pain had redoubled, and during&#13;
         the day things about him faded to shadows of ghostly grey. He almost welcomed the coming of night, for then the world seemed&#13;
         less pale and empty.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The hobbits were still weary, when they set out again early next morning. There were many miles yet to go between them and&#13;
         the Ford, and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Our peril will be greatest just ere we reach the river,’ said Glorfindel; ‘for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now&#13;
         swift behind us, and other danger may be waiting by the Ford.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Road was still running steadily downhill, and there was now in places much grass at either side, in which the hobbits&#13;
         walked when they could, to ease their tired feet. In the late afternoon they came to a place where the Road went suddenly&#13;
         under the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep moist walls of red stone. Echoes&#13;
         ran along as they hurried forward; and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their own. All at once, as if&#13;
         through a gate of light, the Road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open. There at the bottom of a sharp incline&#13;
         they saw before them a long flat mile, and beyond that the Ford of Rivendell. On the further side was a steep brown bank,&#13;
         threaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountains climbed, shoulder above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into&#13;
         the fading sky.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page278"/>&#13;
      <p>There was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind them; a rushing noise as if a wind were rising and pouring&#13;
         through the branches of the pines. One moment Glorfindel turned and listened, then he sprang forward with a loud cry.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Fly!’ he called. ‘Fly!</p>&#13;
      <p>The enemy is upon us!’ The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran down the slope. Glorfindel and Strider followed as&#13;
         rearguard. They were only half way across the flat, when suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping. Out of the gate in&#13;
         the trees that they had just left rode a Black Rider. He reined his horse in, and halted, swaying in his saddle. Another followed&#13;
         him, and then another; then again two more.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ride forward! Ride!’ cried Glorfindel to Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>He did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking the horse to a walk, he turned and looked back. The&#13;
         Riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill, dark and solid, while all the woods and&#13;
         land about them receded as if into a mist. Suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to wait. Then&#13;
         at once fear and hatred awoke in him. His hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he&#13;
         drew it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ride on! Ride on!’ cried Glorfindel, and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the elf-tongue: <em>noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the Road. At the same moment the black horses&#13;
         leaped down the hill in pursuit, and from the Riders came a terrible cry, such as Frodo had heard filling the woods with horror&#13;
         in the Eastfarthing far away. It was answered; and to the dismay of Frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away&#13;
         on the left four other Riders came flying. Two rode towards Frodo; two galloped madly towards the Ford to cut off his escape.&#13;
         They seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and darker, as their courses converged with his.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page279"/>&#13;
      <p>Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could no longer see his friends. The Riders behind were falling back:&#13;
         even their great steeds were no match in speed for the white elf-horse of Glorfindel. He looked forward again, and hope faded.&#13;
         There seemed no chance of reaching the Ford before he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush. He could see them&#13;
         clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside their hoods and black cloaks, and they were robed in white and grey. Swords&#13;
         were naked in their pale hands; helms were on their heads. Their cold eyes glittered, and they called to him with fell voices.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Fear now filled all Frodo’s mind. He thought no longer of his sword. No cry came from him. He shut his eyes and clung to the&#13;
         horse’s mane. The wind whistled in his ears, and the bells upon the harness rang wild and shrill. A breath of deadly cold&#13;
         pierced him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a flash of white fire, the elf-horse speeding as if on wings, passed&#13;
         right before the face of the foremost Rider.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo heard the splash of water. It foamed about his feet. He felt the quick heave and surge as the horse left the river and&#13;
         struggled up the stony path. He was climbing the steep bank. He was across the Ford.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But the pursuers were close behind. At the top of the bank the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercely. There were&#13;
         Nine Riders at the water’s edge below, and Frodo’s spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces. He knew of nothing&#13;
         that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had done; and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the&#13;
         long uncertain path from the Ford to the edge of Rivendell, if once the Riders crossed. In any case he felt that he was commanded&#13;
         urgently to halt. Hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the strength to refuse.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly the foremost Rider spurred his horse forward. It checked at the water and reared up. With a great effort Frodo sat&#13;
         upright and brandished his sword.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Go back!’ he cried. ‘Go back to the Land of Mordor, and &#13;
         <a id="page280"/>follow me no more!’ His voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears. The Riders halted, but Frodo had not the power of Bombadil.&#13;
         His enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter. ‘Come back! Come back!’ they called. ‘To Mordor we will take&#13;
         you!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Go back!’ he whispered.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Ring! The Ring!’ they cried with deadly voices; and immediately their leader urged his horse forward into the water,&#13;
         followed closely by two others.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘By Elbereth and Lúthien the Fair,’ said Frodo with a last effort, lifting up his sword, ‘you shall have neither the Ring&#13;
         nor me!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then the leader, who was now half across the Ford, stood up menacing in his stirrups, and raised up his hand. Frodo was stricken&#13;
         dumb. He felt his tongue cleave to his mouth, and his heart labouring. His sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand. The&#13;
         elf-horse reared and snorted. The foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At that moment there came a roaring and a rushing: a noise of loud waters rolling many stones. Dimly Frodo saw the river below&#13;
         him rise, and down along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves. White flames seemed to Frodo to flicker on their&#13;
         crests, and he half fancied that he saw amid the water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes. The three Riders&#13;
         that were still in the midst of the Ford were overwhelmed: they disappeared, buried suddenly under angry foam. Those that&#13;
         were behind drew back in dismay.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>With his last failing senses Frodo heard cries, and it seemed to him that he saw, beyond the Riders that hesitated on the&#13;
         shore, a shining figure of white light; and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that flared red in the grey mist&#13;
         that was falling over the world.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood. Their&#13;
         piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the river &#13;
         <a id="page281"/>as it carried them away. Then Frodo felt himself falling, and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise and engulf him together&#13;
         with his enemies. He heard and saw no more.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

      <p class="cotx">Frodo woke and found himself lying in bed. At first he thought that he had slept late, after a long unpleasant dream that&#13;
         still hovered on the edge of memory. Or perhaps he had been ill? But the ceiling looked strange; it was flat, and it had dark&#13;
         beams richly carved. He lay a little while longer looking at patches of sunlight on the wall, and listening to the sound of&#13;
         a waterfall.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where am I, and what is the time?’ he said aloud to the ceiling.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘In the house of Elrond, and it is ten o’clock in the morning,’ said a voice. ‘It is the morning of October the twenty-fourth,&#13;
         if you want to know.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Gandalf!’ cried Frodo, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting in a chair by the open window.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ he said, ‘I am here. And you are lucky to be here, too, after all the absurd things you have done since you left home.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo lay down again. He felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did not think he would get the better&#13;
         of an argument. He was fully awake now, and the memory of his journey was returning: the disastrous ‘short cut’ through the&#13;
         Old Forest; the ‘accident’ at <em>The Prancing Pony</em>; and his madness in putting on the Ring in the dell under Weathertop. While he was thinking of all these things and trying&#13;
         in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving in Rivendell, there was a long silence, broken only by the soft puffs of&#13;
         Gandalf ’s pipe, as he blew white smoke-rings out of the window.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where’s Sam?’ Frodo asked at length. ‘And are the others all right?’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page286"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, they are all safe and sound,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Sam was here until I sent him off to get some rest, about half an hour&#13;
         ago.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What happened at the Ford?’ said Frodo. ‘It all seemed so dim, somehow; and it still does.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, it would. You were beginning to fade,’ answered Gandalf. ‘The wound was overcoming you at last. A few more hours and&#13;
         you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! As you showed in the Barrow. That was&#13;
         touch and go: perhaps the most dangerous moment of all. I wish you could have held out at Weathertop.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You seem to know a great deal already,’ said Frodo. ‘I have not spoken to the others about the Barrow. At first it was too&#13;
         horrible, and afterwards there were other things to think about. How do you know about it?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You have talked long in your sleep, Frodo,’ said Gandalf gently, ‘and it has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory.&#13;
         Do not worry! Though I said “absurd” just now, I did not mean it. I think well of you – and of the others. It is no small&#13;
         feat to have come so far, and through such dangers, still bearing the Ring.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We should never have done it without Strider,’ said Frodo. ‘But we needed you. I did not know what to do without you.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I was delayed,’ said Gandalf, ‘and that nearly proved our ruin. And yet I am not sure: it may have been better so.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wish you would tell me what happened!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘All in good time! You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything today, by Elrond’s orders.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘But talking would stop me thinking and wondering, which are quite as tiring,’ said Frodo. ‘I am wide awake now, and I remember&#13;
         so many things that want explaining. Why were you delayed? You ought to tell me that at least.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You will soon hear all you wish to know,’ said Gandalf. ‘We shall have a Council, as soon as you are well enough. At the&#13;
         moment I will only say that I was held captive.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You?’ cried Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page287"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, I, Gandalf the Grey,’ said the wizard solemnly. ‘There are many powers in the world, for good or for evil. Some are&#13;
         greater than I am. Against some I have not yet been measured. But my time is coming. The Morgul-lord and his Black Riders&#13;
         have come forth. War is preparing!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then you knew of the Riders already – before I met them?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the Black Riders are the Ringwraiths, the Nine Servants of the&#13;
         Lord of the Rings. But I did not know that they had arisen again or I should have fled with you at once. I heard news of them&#13;
         only after I left you in June; but that story must wait. For the moment we have been saved from disaster, by Aragorn.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Frodo, ‘it was Strider that saved us. Yet I was afraid of him at first. Sam never quite trusted him, I think,&#13;
         not at any rate until we met Glorfindel.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf smiled. ‘I have heard all about Sam,’ he said. ‘He has no more doubts now.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am glad,’ said Frodo. ‘For I have become very fond of Strider. Well, <em>fond</em> is not the right word. I mean he is dear to me; though he is strange, and grim at times. In fact, he reminds me often of&#13;
         you. I didn’t know that any of the Big People were like that. I thought, well, that they were just big, and rather stupid:&#13;
         kind and stupid like Butterbur; or stupid and wicked like Bill Ferny. But then we don’t know much about Men in the Shire,&#13;
         except perhaps the Bree-landers.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You don’t know much even about them, if you think old Barliman is stupid,’ said Gandalf. ‘He is wise enough on his own ground.&#13;
         He thinks less than he talks, and slower; yet he can see through a brick wall in time (as they say in Bree). But there are&#13;
         few left in Middle-earth like Aragorn son of Arathorn. The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly at an end. It may&#13;
         be that this War of the Ring will be their last adventure.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of the old Kings?’ said Frodo in wonder. ‘I thought they had all vanished&#13;
         long ago. I thought he was only a Ranger.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page288"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Only a Ranger!’ cried Gandalf. ‘My dear Frodo, that is just what the Rangers are: the last remnant in the North of the great&#13;
         people, the Men of the West. They have helped me before; and I shall need their help in the days to come; for we have reached&#13;
         Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at rest.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I suppose not,’ said Frodo. ‘But so far my only thought has been to get here; and I hope I shan’t have to go any further.&#13;
         It is very pleasant just to rest. I have had a month of exile and adventure, and I find that has been as much as I want.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. ‘I have been reckoning,’ he said, ‘and I can’t bring the total&#13;
         up to October the twenty-fourth. It ought to be the twenty-first. We must have reached the Ford by the twentieth.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You have talked and reckoned more than is good for you,’ said Gandalf. ‘How do the side and shoulder feel now?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know,’ Frodo answered. ‘They don’t feel at all: which is an improvement, but’ – he made an effort – ‘I can move my&#13;
         arm again a little. Yes, it is coming back to life. It is not cold,’ he added, touching his left hand with his right.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good!’ said Gandalf. ‘It is mending fast. You will soon be sound again. Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days,&#13;
         ever since you were brought in.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Days?’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, four nights and three days, to be exact. The Elves brought you from the Ford on the night of the twentieth, and that&#13;
         is where you lost count. We have been terribly anxious, and Sam has hardly left your side, day or night, except to run messages.&#13;
         Elrond is a master of healing, but the weapons of our Enemy are deadly. To tell you the truth, I had very little hope; for&#13;
         I suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the closed wound. But it could not be found until last night.&#13;
         Then Elrond removed a splinter. It was deeply buried, and it was working inwards.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo shuddered, remembering the cruel knife with notched blade that had vanished in Strider’s hands. ‘Don’t &#13;
         <a id="page289"/>be alarmed!’ said Gandalf. ‘It is gone now. It has been melted. And it seems that Hobbits fade very reluctantly. I have known&#13;
         strong warriors of the Big People who would quickly have been overcome by that splinter, which you bore for seventeen days.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What would they have done to me?’ asked Frodo. ‘What were the Riders trying to do?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘They tried to pierce your heart with a Morgul-knife which remains in the wound. If they had succeeded, you would have become&#13;
         like they are, only weaker and under their command. You would have become a wraith under the dominion of the Dark Lord; and&#13;
         he would have tormented you for trying to keep his Ring, if any greater torment were possible than being robbed of it and&#13;
         seeing it on his hand.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Thank goodness I did not realize the horrible danger!’ said Frodo faintly. ‘I was mortally afraid, of course; but if I had&#13;
         known more, I should not have dared even to move. It is a marvel that I escaped!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,’ said Gandalf, ‘not to mention courage. For your heart was not touched, and only your&#13;
         shoulder was pierced; and that was because you resisted to the last. But it was a terribly narrow shave, so to speak. You&#13;
         were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring, for then you were half in the wraith-world yourself, and they might have seized&#13;
         you. You could see them, and they could see you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I know,’ said Frodo. ‘They were terrible to behold! But why could we all see their horses?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Because they are real horses; just as the black robes are real robes that they wear to give shape to their nothingness when&#13;
         they have dealings with the living.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then why do these black horses endure such riders? All other animals are terrified when they draw near, even the elf-horse&#13;
         of Glorfindel. The dogs howl and the geese scream at them.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark Lord in Mordor. Not all his servants and chattels &#13;
         <a id="page290"/>are wraiths! There are orcs and trolls, there are wargs and werewolves; and there have been and still are many Men, warriors&#13;
         and kings, that walk alive under the Sun, and yet are under his sway. And their number is growing daily.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What about Rivendell and the Elves? Is Rivendell safe?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, at present, until all else is conquered. The Elves may fear the Dark Lord, and they may fly before him, but never again&#13;
         will they listen to him or serve him. And here in Rivendell there live still some of his chief foes: the Elven-wise, lords&#13;
         of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas. They do not fear the Ringwraiths, for those who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm&#13;
         live at once in both worlds, and against both the Seen and the Unseen they have great power.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I thought that I saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the others. Was that Glorfindel then?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: one of the mighty of the Firstborn. He is an Elf-lord of a house&#13;
         of princes. Indeed there is a power in Rivendell to withstand the might of Mordor, for a while: and elsewhere other powers&#13;
         still dwell. There is power, too, of another kind in the Shire. But all such places will soon become islands under siege,&#13;
         if things go on as they are going. The Dark Lord is putting forth all his strength.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Still,’ he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin, while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire,&#13;
         ‘we must keep up our courage. You will soon be well, if I do not talk you to death. You are in Rivendell, and you need not&#13;
         worry about anything for the present.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I haven’t any courage to keep up,’ said Frodo, ‘but I am not worried at the moment. Just give me news of my friends, and&#13;
         tell me the end of the affair at the Ford, as I keep on asking, and I shall be content for the present. After that I shall&#13;
         have another sleep, I think; but I shan’t be able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took a good look at Frodo. The colour had come back to his face, and his eyes were&#13;
         clear, and fully awake and aware. He was smiling, &#13;
         <a id="page291"/>and there seemed to be little wrong with him. But to the wizard’s eye there was a faint change, just a hint as it were of&#13;
         transparency, about him, and especially about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Still that must be expected,’ said Gandalf to himself. ‘He is not half through yet, and to what he will come in the end not&#13;
         even Elrond can foretell. Not to evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that&#13;
         can.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You look splendid,’ he said aloud. ‘I will risk a brief tale without consulting Elrond. But quite brief, mind you, and then&#13;
         you must sleep again. This is what happened, as far as I can gather. The Riders made straight for you, as soon as you fled.&#13;
         They did not need the guidance of their horses any longer: you had become visible to them, being already on the threshold&#13;
         of their world. And also the Ring drew them. Your friends sprang aside, off the road, or they would have been ridden down.&#13;
         They knew that nothing could save you, if the white horse could not. The Riders were too swift to overtake, and too many to&#13;
         oppose. On foot even Glorfindel and Aragorn together could not withstand all the Nine at once.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘When the Ringwraiths swept by, your friends ran up behind. Close to the Ford there is a small hollow beside the road masked&#13;
         by a few stunted trees. There they hastily kindled fire; for Glorfindel knew that a flood would come down, if the Riders tried&#13;
         to cross, and then he would have to deal with any that were left on his side of the river. The moment the flood appeared,&#13;
         he rushed out, followed by Aragorn and the others with flaming brands. Caught between fire and water, and seeing an Elf-lord&#13;
         revealed in his wrath, they were dismayed, and their horses were stricken with madness. Three were carried away by the first&#13;
         assault of the flood; the others were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And is that the end of the Black Riders?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No,’ said Gandalf. ‘Their horses must have perished, and without them they are crippled. But the Ringwraiths &#13;
         <a id="page292"/>themselves cannot be so easily destroyed. However, there is nothing more to fear from them at present. Your friends crossed&#13;
         after the flood had passed and they found you lying on your face at the top of the bank, with a broken sword under you. The&#13;
         horse was standing guard beside you. You were pale and cold, and they feared that you were dead, or worse. Elrond’s folk met&#13;
         them, carrying you slowly towards Rivendell.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who made the flood?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Elrond commanded it,’ answered Gandalf. ‘The river of this valley is under his power, and it will rise in anger when he has&#13;
         great need to bar the Ford. As soon as the captain of the Ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was released. If I may&#13;
         say so, I added a few touches of my own: you may not have noticed, but some of the waves took the form of great white horses&#13;
         with shining white riders; and there were many rolling and grinding boulders. For a moment I was afraid that we had let loose&#13;
         too fierce a wrath, and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away. There is great vigour in the waters that come&#13;
         down from the snows of the Misty Mountains.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, it all comes back to me now,’ said Frodo: ‘the tremendous roaring. I thought I was drowning, with my friends and enemies&#13;
         and all. But now we are safe!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf looked quickly at Frodo, but he had shut his eyes. ‘Yes, you are all safe for the present. Soon there will be feasting&#13;
         and merrymaking to celebrate the victory at the Ford of Bruinen, and you will all be there in places of honour.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Splendid!’ said Frodo. ‘It is wonderful that Elrond, and Glorfindel and such great lords, not to mention Strider, should&#13;
         take so much trouble and show me so much kindness.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, there are many reasons why they should,’ said Gandalf, smiling. ‘I am one good reason. The Ring is another: you are&#13;
         the Ring-bearer. And you are the heir of Bilbo, the Ring-finder.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Dear Bilbo!’ said Frodo sleepily. ‘I wonder where he is. I wish he was here and could hear all about it. It would have &#13;
         <a id="page293"/>made him laugh. The cow jumped over the Moon! And the poor old troll!’ With that he fell fast asleep.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Frodo was now safe in the Last Homely House east of the Sea. That house was, as Bilbo had long ago reported, ‘a perfect house,&#13;
         whether you like food or sleep or story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture of them&#13;
         all’. Merely to be there was a cure for weariness, fear, and sadness.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As the evening drew on, Frodo woke up again, and he found that he no longer felt in need of rest or sleep, but had a mind&#13;
         for food and drink, and probably for singing and story-telling afterwards. He got out of bed and discovered that his arm was&#13;
         already nearly as useful again as it ever had been. He found laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently.&#13;
         Looking in a mirror he was startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered: it looked remarkably like&#13;
         the young nephew of Bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the Shire; but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped out of a looking-glass,’ he said to his reflection. ‘But now for&#13;
         a merry meeting!’ He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At that moment there was a knock on the door, and Sam came in. He ran to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly and shyly.&#13;
         He stroked it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hullo, Sam!’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It’s warm!’ said Sam. ‘Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It has felt so cold through the long nights. But glory and trumpets!’&#13;
         he cried, turning round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor. ‘It’s fine to see you up and yourself again, sir!&#13;
         Gandalf asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down, and I thought he was joking.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am ready,’ said Frodo. ‘Let’s go and look for the rest of the party!’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page294"/>&#13;
      <p>‘I can take you to them, sir,’ said Sam. ‘It’s a big house this, and very peculiar. Always a bit more to discover, and no&#13;
         knowing what you’ll find round a corner. And Elves, sir! Elves here, and Elves there! Some like kings, terrible and splendid;&#13;
         and some as merry as children. And the music and the singing – not that I have had the time or the heart for much listening&#13;
         since we got here. But I’m getting to know some of the ways of the place.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I know what you have been doing, Sam,’ said Frodo, taking his arm. ‘But you shall be merry tonight, and listen to your heart’s&#13;
         content. Come on, guide me round the corners!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high garden above the steep bank of the river. He found&#13;
         his friends sitting in a porch on the side of the house looking east. Shadows had fallen in the valley below, but there was&#13;
         still a light on the faces of the mountains far above. The air was warm. The sound of running and falling water was loud,&#13;
         and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers, as if summer still lingered in Elrond’s gardens.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hurray!’ cried Pippin, springing up. ‘Here is our noble cousin! Make way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hush!’ said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the porch. ‘Evil things do not come into this valley; but all the same&#13;
         we should not name them. The Lord of the Ring is not Frodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of Mordor, whose power is again&#13;
         stretching out over the world. We are sitting in a fortress. Outside it is getting dark.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that,’ said Pippin. ‘He thinks I need keeping in order. But it seems impossible,&#13;
         somehow, to feel gloomy or depressed in this place. I feel I could sing, if I knew the right song for the occasion.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I feel like singing myself,’ laughed Frodo. ‘Though at the moment I feel more like eating and drinking.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That will soon be cured,’ said Pippin. ‘You have shown your usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal.’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page295"/>&#13;
      <p>‘More than a meal! A feast!’ said Merry. ‘As soon as Gandalf reported that you were recovered, the preparations began.’ He&#13;
         had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The hall of Elrond’s house was filled with folk: Elves for the most part, though there were a few guests of other sorts. Elrond,&#13;
         as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the one side sat Glorfindel,&#13;
         on the other side sat Gandalf.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo looked at them in wonder; for he had never before seen Elrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they sat upon his&#13;
         right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even Gandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity&#13;
         and power.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders,&#13;
         made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like&#13;
         coals that could leap suddenly into fire.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his&#13;
         eyes were bright and keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was strength.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful.&#13;
         His hair was dark as the shadows of twilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his eyes were grey as a clear evening,&#13;
         and in them was a light like the light of stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many winters, and yet hale as&#13;
         a tried warrior in the fulness of his strength. He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among both Elves and Men.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a lady&#13;
         fair to look upon, and so like was she in form of womanhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his &#13;
         <a id="page296"/>close kindred. Young she was and yet not so. The braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost; her white arms and clear&#13;
         face were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly she looked,&#13;
         and thought and knowledge were in her glance, as of one who has known many things that the years bring. Above her brow her&#13;
         head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with small gems, glittering white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament&#13;
         save a girdle of leaves wrought in silver.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>So it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that the likeness&#13;
         of Lúthien had come on earth again; and she was called Undómiel, for she was the Evenstar of her people. Long she had been&#13;
         in the land of her mother’s kin, in Lórien beyond the mountains, and was but lately returned to Rivendell to her father’s&#13;
         house. But her brothers, Elladan and Elrohir, were out upon errantry; for they rode often far afield with the Rangers of the&#13;
         North, forgetting never their mother’s torment in the dens of the orcs.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Such loveliness in living thing Frodo had never seen before nor imagined in his mind; and he was both surprised and abashed&#13;
         to find that he had a seat at Elrond’s table among all these folk so high and fair. Though he had a suitable chair, and was&#13;
         raised upon several cushions, he felt very small, and rather out of place; but that feeling quickly passed. The feast was&#13;
         merry and the food all that his hunger could desire. It was some time before he looked about him again or even turned to his&#13;
         neighbours.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He looked first for his friends. Sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his master, but had been told that for this time&#13;
         he was a guest of honour. Frodo could see him now, sitting with Pippin and Merry at the upper end of one of the side-tables&#13;
         close to the dais. He could see no sign of Strider.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly dressed. His beard, very long and forked, was &#13;
         <a id="page297"/>white, nearly as white as the snow-white cloth of his garments. He wore a silver belt, and round his neck hung a chain of&#13;
         silver and diamonds. Frodo stopped eating to look at him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Welcome and well met!’ said the dwarf, turning towards him. Then he actually rose from his seat and bowed. ‘Glóin at your&#13;
         service,’ he said, and bowed still lower.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Frodo Baggins at your service and your family’s,’ said Frodo correctly, rising in surprise and scattering his cushions. ‘Am&#13;
         I right in guessing that you are <em>the</em> Glóin, one of the twelve companions of the great Thorin Oakenshield?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Quite right,’ answered the dwarf, gathering up the cushions and courteously assisting Frodo back into his seat. ‘And I do&#13;
         not ask, for I have already been told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our friend Bilbo the renowned. Allow me&#13;
         to congratulate you on your recovery.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Thank you very much,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You have had some very strange adventures, I hear,’ said Glóin. ‘I wonder greatly what brings <em>four</em> hobbits on so long a journey. Nothing like it has happened since Bilbo came with us. But perhaps I should not inquire too&#13;
         closely, since Elrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,’ said Frodo politely. He guessed that even in Elrond’s house the matter&#13;
         of the Ring was not one for casual talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time. ‘But I am equally curious,’&#13;
         he added, ‘to learn what brings so important a dwarf so far from the Lonely Mountain.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Glóin looked at him. ‘If you have not heard, I think we will not speak yet of that either. Master Elrond will summon us all&#13;
         ere long, I believe, and then we shall all hear many things. But there is much else that may be told.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Throughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but Frodo listened more than he spoke; for the news of the Shire, apart&#13;
         from the Ring, seemed small and far-away and unimportant, while Glóin had much to tell of events in the northern regions of&#13;
         Wilderland. Frodo learned that Grimbeorn the Old, son of Beorn, was now the lord of many sturdy men, &#13;
         <a id="page298"/>and to their land between the Mountains and Mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Indeed,’ said Glóin, ‘if it were not for the Beornings, the passage from Dale to Rivendell would long ago have become impossible.&#13;
         They are valiant men and keep open the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock. But their tolls are high,’ he added with a shake&#13;
         of his head; ‘and like Beorn of old they are not over fond of dwarves. Still, they are trusty, and that is much in these days.&#13;
         Nowhere are there any men so friendly to us as the Men of Dale. They are good folk, the Bardings. The grandson of Bard the&#13;
         Bowman rules them, Brand son of Bain son of Bard. He is a strong king, and his realm now reaches far south and east of Esgaroth.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And what of your own people?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is much to tell, good and bad,’ said Glóin; ‘yet it is mostly good: we have so far been fortunate, though we do not&#13;
         escape the shadow of these times. If you really wish to hear of us, I will tell you tidings gladly. But stop me when you are&#13;
         weary! Dwarves’ tongues run on when speaking of their handiwork, they say.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>And with that Glóin embarked on a long account of the doings of the Dwarf-kingdom. He was delighted to have found so polite&#13;
         a listener; for Frodo showed no sign of weariness and made no attempt to change the subject, though actually he soon got rather&#13;
         lost among the strange names of people and places that he had never heard of before. He was interested, however, to hear that&#13;
         Dáin was still King under the Mountain, and was now old (having passed his two hundred and fiftieth year), venerable, and&#13;
         fabulously rich. Of the ten companions who had survived the Battle of Five Armies seven were still with him: Dwalin, Glóin,&#13;
         Dori, Nori, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur. Bombur was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at&#13;
         table, and it took six young dwarves to lift him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And what has become of Balin and Ori and Óin?<sub>’</sub>asked Frodo.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>A shadow passed over Glóin’s face. ‘We do not know,’ he &#13;
         <a id="page299"/>answered. ‘It is largely on account of Balin that I have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in Rivendell. But tonight&#13;
         let us speak of merrier things!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Glóin began then to talk of the works of his people, telling Frodo about their great labours in Dale and under the Mountain.&#13;
         ‘We have done well,’ he said. ‘But in metal-work we cannot rival our fathers, many of whose secrets are lost. We make good&#13;
         armour and keen swords, but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that were made before the dragon came. Only&#13;
         in mining and building have we surpassed the old days. You should see the waterways of Dale, Frodo, and the fountains, and&#13;
         the pools! You should see the stone-paved roads of many colours! And the halls and cavernous streets under the earth with&#13;
         arches carved like trees; and the terraces and towers upon the Mountain’s sides! Then you would see that we have not been&#13;
         idle.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will come and see them, if ever I can,’ said Frodo. ‘How surprised Bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the&#13;
         Desolation of Smaug!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Glóin looked at Frodo and smiled. ‘You were very fond of Bilbo were you not?’ he asked.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ answered Frodo. ‘I would rather see him than all the towers and palaces in the world.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At length the feast came to an end. Elrond and Arwen rose and went down the hall, and the company followed them in due order.&#13;
         The doors were thrown open, and they went across a wide passage and through other doors, and came into a further hall. In&#13;
         it were no tables, but a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between the carven pillars upon either side.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo found himself walking with Gandalf. ‘This is the Hall of Fire,’ said the wizard. ‘Here you will hear many songs and&#13;
         tales – if you can keep awake. But except on high days it usually stands empty and quiet, and people come here who wish for&#13;
         peace, and thought. There is always a fire here, all the year round, but there is little other light.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page300"/>&#13;
      <p>As Elrond entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, Elvish minstrels began to make sweet music. Slowly the hall&#13;
         filled, and Frodo looked with delight upon the many fair faces that were gathered together; the golden firelight played upon&#13;
         them and shimmered in their hair. Suddenly he noticed, not far from the further end of the fire, a small dark figure seated&#13;
         on a stool with his back propped against a pillar. Beside him on the ground was a drinking-cup and some bread. Frodo wondered&#13;
         whether he was ill (if people were ever ill in Rivendell), and had been unable to come to the feast. His head seemed sunk&#13;
         in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his dark cloak was drawn over his face.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Elrond went forward and stood beside the silent figure. ‘Awake, little master!’ he said, with a smile. Then, turning to Frodo,&#13;
         he beckoned to him. ‘Now at last the hour has come that you have wished for, Frodo,’ he said. ‘Here is a friend that you have&#13;
         long missed.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face. ‘Bilbo!’ cried Frodo with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hullo, Frodo my lad!’ said Bilbo. ‘So you have got here at last. I hoped you would manage it. Well, well! So all this feasting&#13;
         is in your honour, I hear. I hope you enjoyed yourself?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Why weren’t you there?’ cried Frodo. ‘And why haven’t I been allowed to see you before?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of <em>you</em>. I have sat by your side with Sam each day. But as for the feast, I don’t go in for such things much now. And I had something&#13;
         else to do.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What were you doing?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Why, sitting and thinking. I do a lot of that nowadays, and this is the best place to do it in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!’&#13;
         he said, cocking an eye at Elrond. There was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness that Frodo could see. ‘Wake&#13;
         up! I was not asleep, Master Elrond. If you want to know, you have all come out from your feast too soon, and you &#13;
         <a id="page301"/>have disturbed me – in the middle of making up a song. I was stuck over a line or two, and was thinking about them; but now&#13;
         I don’t suppose I shall ever get them right. There will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be driven clean out&#13;
         of my head. I shall have to get my friend the Dúnadan to help me. Where is he?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Elrond laughed. ‘He shall be found,’ he said. ‘Then you two shall go into a corner and finish your task, and we will hear&#13;
         it and judge it before we end our merrymaking.’ Messengers were sent to find Bilbo’s friend, though none knew where he was,&#13;
         or why he had not been present at the feast.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In the meanwhile Frodo and Bilbo sat side by side, and Sam came quickly and placed himself near them. They talked together&#13;
         in soft voices, oblivious of the mirth and music in the hall about them. Bilbo had not much to say of himself. When he had&#13;
         left Hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly, along the Road or in the country on either side; but somehow he had steered all&#13;
         the time towards Rivendell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I got here without much adventure,’ he said, ‘and after a rest I went on with the dwarves to Dale: my last journey. I shan’t&#13;
         travel again. Old Balin had gone away. Then I came back here, and here I have been. I have done this and that. I have written&#13;
         some more of my book. And, of course, I make up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just to please me, I think; for,&#13;
         of course, they aren’t really good enough for Rivendell. And I listen and I think. Time doesn’t seem to pass here: it just&#13;
         is. A remarkable place altogether.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I hear all kinds of news, from over the Mountains, and out of the South, but hardly anything from the Shire. I heard about&#13;
         the Ring, of course. Gandalf has been here often. Not that he has told me a great deal, he has become closer than ever these&#13;
         last few years. The Dúnadan has told me more. Fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance! It is a pity that Gandalf&#13;
         did not find out more sooner. I could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much trouble. I have thought&#13;
         several times of going back to Hobbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would not let me:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page302"/>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf and Elrond, I mean. They seemed to think that the Enemy was looking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat&#13;
         of me, if he caught me tottering about in the Wild.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And Gandalf said: “The Ring has passed on, Bilbo. It would do no good to you or to others, if you tried to meddle with it&#13;
         again.” Odd sort of remark, just like Gandalf. But he said he was looking after you, so I let things be. I am frightfully&#13;
         glad to see you safe and sound.’ He paused and looked at Frodo doubtfully.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Have you got it here?’ he asked in a whisper. ‘I can’t help feeling curious, you know, after all I’ve heard. I should very&#13;
         much like just to peep at it again.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, I’ve got it,’ answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluctance. ‘It looks just the same as ever it did.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, I should just like to see it for a moment,’ said Bilbo.</p>&#13;
      <p>When he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong.&#13;
         Slowly he drew it out. Bilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly drew back the Ring. To his distress and amazement he found&#13;
         that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself eyeing&#13;
         a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands. He felt a desire to strike him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The music and singing round them seemed to falter, and a silence fell. Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo’s face and passed his&#13;
         hand across his eyes. ‘I understand now,’ he said. ‘Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have come in for this burden; sorry&#13;
         about everything. Don’t adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. Well, it&#13;
         can’t be helped. I wonder if it’s any good trying to finish my book? But don’t let’s worry about it now – let’s have some&#13;
         real News! Tell me all about the Shire!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Frodo hid the Ring away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory. The light and music of Rivendell &#13;
         <a id="page303"/>was about him again. Bilbo smiled and laughed happily. Every item of news from the Shire that Frodo could tell – aided and&#13;
         corrected now and again by Sam – was of the greatest interest to him, from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of&#13;
         the smallest child in Hobbiton. They were so deep in the doings of the Four Farthings that they did not notice the arrival&#13;
         of a man clad in dark green cloth. For many minutes he stood looking down at them with a smile.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly Bilbo looked up. ‘Ah, there you are at last, Dúnadan!’ he cried.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Strider!’ said Frodo. ‘You seem to have a lot of names.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, <em>Strider</em> is one that I haven’t heard before, anyway,’ said Bilbo. ‘What do you call him that for?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘They call me that in Bree,’ said Strider laughing, ‘and that is how I was introduced to him.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘And why do you call him Dúnadan?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>The</em> Dúnadan,’ said Bilbo. ‘He is often called that here. But I thought you knew enough Elvish at least to know <em>dúnadan</em>: Man of the West, Númenórean. But this is not the time for lessons!’ He turned to Strider. ‘Where have you been, my friend?&#13;
         Why weren’t you at the feast? The Lady Arwen was there.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Strider looked down at Bilbo gravely. ‘I know,’ he said. ‘But often I must put mirth aside. Elladan and Elrohir have returned&#13;
         out of the Wild unlooked-for, and they had tidings that I wished to hear at once.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, my dear fellow,’ said Bilbo, ‘now you’ve heard the news, can’t you spare me a moment? I want your help in something&#13;
         urgent. Elrond says this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening, and I am stuck. Let’s go off into a&#13;
         corner and polish it up!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Strider smiled. ‘Come then!’ he said. ‘Let me hear it!’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Frodo was left to himself for a while, for Sam had fallen asleep. He was alone and felt rather forlorn, although all about&#13;
         him the folk of Rivendell were gathered. But those near him were silent, intent upon the music of the voices and the &#13;
         <a id="page304"/>instruments, and they gave no heed to anything else. Frodo began to listen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though he understood them little, held&#13;
         him in a spell, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands&#13;
         and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above&#13;
         seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike, until he felt&#13;
         that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended;&#13;
         it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. Swiftly he sank under its shining weight into&#13;
         a deep realm of sleep.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be&#13;
         the voice of Bilbo chanting verses. Faint at first and then clearer ran the words.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Eärendil was a mariner</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>he turned in haste, and roving still</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>on starless waters far astray</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>at last he came to Night of Naught,</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>The winds of wrath came driving him,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>and blindly in the foam he fled</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>from west to east, and errandless,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>unheralded he homeward sped.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>There flying Elwing came to him,</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>The Silmaril she bound on him</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>he turned his prow; and in the night</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>from Otherworld beyond the Sea</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>A wanderer escaped from night</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>and burning as an island star</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>a distant flame before the Sun,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>a wonder ere the waking dawn</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>where grey the Norland waters run.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>And over Middle-earth he passed</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>and heard at last the weeping sore</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>of women and of elven-maids</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>in Elder Days, in years of yore.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>But on him mighty doom was laid,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>till Moon should fade, an orbéd star</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>to pass, and tarry never more</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page308"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>on Hither Shores where mortals are;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>for ever still a herald on</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>an errand that should never rest</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>to bear his shining lamp afar,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>the Flammifer of Westernesse.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>The chanting ceased. Frodo opened his eyes and saw that Bilbo was seated on his stool in a circle of listeners, who were smiling&#13;
         and applauding.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now we had better have it again,’ said an Elf.</p>&#13;
      <p>Bilbo got up and bowed. ‘I am flattered, Lindir,’ he said. ‘But it would be too tiring to repeat it all.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not too tiring for you,’ the Elves answered laughing. ‘You know you are never tired of reciting your own verses. But really&#13;
         we cannot answer your question at one hearing!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What!’ cried Bilbo. ‘You can’t tell which parts were mine, and which were the Dúnadan’s?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is not easy for us to tell the difference between two mortals,’ said the Elf.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Nonsense, Lindir,’ snorted Bilbo. ‘If you can’t distinguish between a Man and a Hobbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined.&#13;
         They’re as different as peas and apples.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Maybe. To sheep other sheep no doubt appear different,’ laughed Lindir. ‘Or to shepherds. But Mortals have not been our study.&#13;
         We have other business.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I won’t argue with you,’ said Bilbo. ‘I am sleepy after so much music and singing. I’ll leave you to guess, if you want to.’</p>&#13;
      <p>He got up and came towards Frodo. ‘Well, that’s over,’ he said in a low voice. ‘It went off better than I expected. I don’t&#13;
         often get asked for a second hearing. What did you think of it?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am not going to try and guess,’ said Frodo smiling.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You needn’t,’ said Bilbo. ‘As a matter of fact it was all mine. Except that Aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone.&#13;
         He seemed to think it important. I don’t know why. Otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing rather above &#13;
         <a id="page309"/>my head, and he said that if I had the cheek to make verses about Eärendil in the house of Elrond, it was my affair. I suppose&#13;
         he was right.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know,’ said Frodo. ‘It seemed to me to fit somehow, though I can’t explain. I was half asleep when you began, and&#13;
         it seemed to follow on from something that I was dreaming about. I didn’t understand that it was really you speaking until&#13;
         near the end.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It <em>is</em> difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it,’ said Bilbo. ‘Not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the Elvish&#13;
         appetite for music and poetry and tales. They seem to like them as much as food, or more. They will be going on for a long&#13;
         time yet. What do you say to slipping off for some more quiet talk?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Can we?’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of course. This is merrymaking not business. Come and go as you like, as long as you don’t make a noise.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb3">They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the doors. Sam they left behind, fast asleep still with a&#13;
         smile on his face. In spite of his delight in Bilbo’s company Frodo felt a tug of regret as they passed out of the Hall of&#13;
         Fire. Even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in song.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>A Elbereth Gilthoniel,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>silivren penna míriel</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>o menel aglar elenath!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Na-chaered palan-díriel</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>o galadhremmin ennorath,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Fanuilos, le linnathon</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>nef aear, sí nef aearon!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo halted for a moment, looking back. Elrond was in his chair and the fire was on his face like summer-light upon the trees.&#13;
         Near him sat the Lady Arwen. To his surprise Frodo saw that Aragorn stood beside her; his dark cloak was &#13;
         <a id="page310"/>thrown back, and he seemed to be clad in elven-mail, and a star shone on his breast. They spoke together, and then suddenly&#13;
         it seemed to Frodo that Arwen turned towards him, and the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the Elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody.&#13;
         ‘It is a song to Elbereth,’ said Bilbo. ‘They will sing that, and other songs of the Blessed Realm, many times tonight. Come&#13;
         on!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He led Frodo back to his own little room. It opened on to the gardens and looked south across the ravine of the Bruinen. There&#13;
         they sat for some while, looking through the window at the bright stars above the steep-climbing woods, and talking softly.&#13;
         They spoke no more of the small news of the Shire far away, nor of the dark shadows and perils that encompassed them, but&#13;
         of the fair things they had seen in the world together, of the Elves, of the stars, of trees, and the gentle fall of the bright&#13;
         year in the woods.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At last there came a knock on the door. ‘Begging your pardon,’ said Sam, putting in his head, ‘but I was just wondering if&#13;
         you would be wanting anything.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And begging yours, Sam Gamgee,’ replied Bilbo. ‘I guess you mean that it is time your master went to bed.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, sir, there is a Council early tomorrow, I hear, and he only got up today for the first time.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Quite right, Sam,’ laughed Bilbo. ‘You can trot off and tell Gandalf that he has gone to bed. Good night, Frodo! Bless me,&#13;
         but it has been good to see you again! There are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good talk. I am getting very old,&#13;
         and I began to wonder if I should live to see your chapters of our story. Good night! I’ll take a walk, I think, and look&#13;
         at the stars of Elbereth in the garden. Sleep well!’&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-14">THE COUNCIL OF ELROND</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">Next day Frodo woke early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along the terraces above the loud-flowing Bruinen and watched&#13;
         the pale, cool sun rise above the far mountains, and shine down, slanting through the thin silver mist; the dew upon the yellow&#13;
         leaves was glimmering, and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush. Sam walked beside him, saying nothing, but sniffing&#13;
         the air, and looking every now and again with wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the East. The snow was white upon&#13;
         their peaks.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>On a seat cut in the stone beside a turn in the path they came upon Gandalf and Bilbo deep in talk. ‘Hullo! Good morning!’&#13;
         said Bilbo. ‘Feel ready for the great council?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I feel ready for anything,’ answered Frodo. ‘But most of all I should like to go walking today and explore the valley. I&#13;
         should like to get into those pine-woods up there.’ He pointed away far up the side of Rivendell to the north.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You may have a chance later,’ said Gandalf. ‘But we cannot make any plans yet. There is much to hear and decide today.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. ‘That is the warning bell for the Council of Elrond,’ cried Gandalf.&#13;
         ‘Come along now! Both you and Bilbo are wanted.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo and Bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back to the house; behind them, uninvited and for the moment&#13;
         forgotten, trotted Sam.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf led them to the porch where Frodo had found his friends the evening before. The light of the clear autumn morning&#13;
         was now glowing in the valley. The noise of bubbling waters came up from the foaming river-bed. Birds were singing, and a&#13;
         wholesome peace lay on the land. To Frodo &#13;
         <a id="page312"/>his dangerous flight, and the rumours of the darkness growing in the world outside, already seemed only the memories of a&#13;
         troubled dream; but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered were grave.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Elrond was there, and several others were seated in silence about him. Frodo saw Glorfindel and Glóin; and in a corner alone&#13;
         Strider was sitting, clad in his old travel-worn clothes again. Elrond drew Frodo to a seat by his side, and presented him&#13;
         to the company, saying:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here, my friends, is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo. Few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more&#13;
         urgent.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He then pointed out and named those whom Frodo had not met before. There was a younger dwarf at Glóin’s side: his son Gimli.&#13;
         Beside Glorfindel there were several other counsellors of Elrond’s household, of whom Erestor was the chief; and with him&#13;
         was Galdor, an Elf from the Grey Havens who had come on an errand from Círdan the Shipwright. There was also a strange Elf&#13;
         clad in green and brown, Legolas, a messenger from his father, Thranduil, the King of the Elves of Northern Mirkwood. And&#13;
         seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-haired and grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and indeed though his garments were rich, and his cloak was lined&#13;
         with fur, they were stained with long travel. He had a collar of silver in which a single white stone was set; his locks were&#13;
         shorn about his shoulders. On a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laid upon his knees. He gazed&#13;
         at Frodo and Bilbo with sudden wonder.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here,’ said Elrond, turning to Gandalf, ‘is Boromir, a man from the South. He arrived in the grey morning, and seeks for&#13;
         counsel. I have bidden him to be present, for here his questions will be answered.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Not all that was spoken and debated in the Council need now be told. Much was said of events in the world outside, &#13;
         <a id="page313"/>especially in the South, and in the wide lands east of the Mountains. Of these things Frodo had already heard many rumours;&#13;
         but the tale of Glóin was new to him, and when the dwarf spoke he listened attentively. It appeared that amid the splendour&#13;
         of their works of hand the hearts of the Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were troubled.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is now many years ago,’ said Glóin, ‘that a shadow of disquiet fell upon our people. Whence it came we did not at first&#13;
         perceive. Words began to be whispered in secret: it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place, and that greater wealth&#13;
         and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some spoke of Moria: the mighty works of our fathers that are called in our&#13;
         own tongue Khazad-dûm; and they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to return.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Glóin sighed. ‘Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we delved there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have&#13;
         its vast mansions lain empty since the children of Durin fled. But now we spoke of it again with longing, and yet with dread;&#13;
         for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of Khazad-dûm for many lives of kings, save Thrór only, and he perished. At last,&#13;
         however, Balin listened to the whispers, and resolved to go; and though Dáin did not give leave willingly, he took with him&#13;
         Ori and Óin<sub/>and many of our folk, and they went away south.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That was nigh on thirty years ago. For a while we had news and it seemed good: messages reported that Moria had been entered&#13;
         and a great work begun there. Then there was silence, and no word has ever come from Moria since.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then about a year ago a messenger came to Dáin, but not from Moria – from Mordor: a horseman in the night, who called Dáin&#13;
         to his gate. The Lord Sauron the Great, so he said, wished for our friendship. Rings he would give for it, such as he gave&#13;
         of old. And he asked urgently concerning <em>hobbits</em>, of what kind they were, and where they dwelt. “For Sauron knows,” said he, “that one of these was known to you on a time.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page314"/>&#13;
      <p>And then his fell voice was lowered, and he would have sweetened it if he could. “As a small token only of your friendship&#13;
         Sauron asks this,” he said: “that you should find this thief,” such was his word, “and get from him, willing or no, a little&#13;
         ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. It is but a trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good will. Find&#13;
         it, and three rings that the Dwarf-sires possessed of old shall be returned to you, and the realm of Moria shall be yours&#13;
         for ever. Find only news of the thief, whether he still lives and where, and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship&#13;
         from the Lord. Refuse, and things will not seem so well. Do you refuse?”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘At that his breath came like the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by shuddered, but Dáin said: “I say neither yea nor nay.&#13;
         I must consider this message and what it means under its fair cloak.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Consider well, but not too long,” said he.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “The time of my thought is my own to spend,” answered Dáin.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “For the present,” said he, and rode into the darkness.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night. We needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that&#13;
         his words held both menace and deceit; for we knew already that the power that has re-entered Mordor has not changed, and&#13;
         ever it betrayed us of old. Twice the messenger has returned, and has gone unanswered. The third and last time, so he says,&#13;
         is soon to come, before the ending of the year.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And so I have been sent at last by Dáin to warn Bilbo that he is sought by the Enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires&#13;
         this ring, this least of rings. Also we crave the advice of Elrond. For the Shadow grows and draws nearer. We discover that&#13;
         messengers have come also to King Brand in Dale, and that he is afraid. We fear that he may yield. Already war is gathering&#13;
         on his eastern borders. If we make no answer, the Enemy may move Men of his rule to assail King Brand, and Dáin also.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page315"/>&#13;
      <p>‘You have done well to come,’ said Elrond. ‘You will hear today all that you need in order to understand the purposes of the&#13;
         Enemy. There is naught that you can do, other than to resist, with hope or without it. But you do not stand alone. You will&#13;
         learn that your trouble is but part of the trouble of all the western world. The Ring! What shall we do with the Ring, the&#13;
         least of rings, the trifle that Sauron fancies? That is the doom that we must deem.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is the purpose for which you are called hither. Called, I say, though I have not called you to me, strangers from distant&#13;
         lands. You have come and are here met, in this very nick of time, by chance as it may seem. Yet it is not so. Believe rather&#13;
         that it is so ordered that we, who sit here, and none others, must now find counsel for the peril of the world.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now, therefore, things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all but a few until this day. And first, so that&#13;
         all may understand what is the peril, the Tale of the Ring shall be told from the beginning even to this present. And I will&#13;
         begin that tale, though others shall end it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Then all listened while Elrond in his clear voice spoke of Sauron and the Rings of Power, and their forging in the Second&#13;
         Age of the world long ago. A part of his tale was known to some there, but the full tale to none, and many eyes were turned&#13;
         to Elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the Elven-smiths of Eregion and their friendship with Moria, and their eagerness&#13;
         for knowledge, by which Sauron ensnared them. For in that time he was not yet evil to behold, and they received his aid and&#13;
         grew mighty in craft, whereas he learned all their secrets, and betrayed them, and forged secretly in the Mountain of Fire&#13;
         the One Ring to be their master. But Celebrimbor was aware of him, and hid the Three which he had made; and there was war,&#13;
         and the land was laid waste, and the gate of Moria was shut.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then through all the years that followed he traced the Ring; but since that history is elsewhere recounted, even as</p>&#13;
      <a id="page316"/>&#13;
      <p>Elrond himself set it down in his books of lore, it is not here recalled. For it is a long tale, full of deeds great and terrible,&#13;
         and briefly though Elrond spoke, the sun rode up the sky, and the morning was passing ere he ceased.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Of Númenor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the Kings of Men to Middle-earth out of the deeps of the Sea,&#13;
         borne upon the wings of storm. Then Elendil the Tall and his mighty sons, Isildur and Anárion, became great lords; and the&#13;
         North-realm they made in Arnor, and the South-realm in Gondor above the mouths of Anduin. But Sauron of Mordor assailed them,&#13;
         and they made the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and the hosts of Gil-galad and Elendil were mustered in Arnor.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Thereupon Elrond paused a while and sighed. ‘I remember well the splendour of their banners,’ he said. ‘It recalled to me&#13;
         the glory of the Elder Days and the hosts of Beleriand, so many great princes and captains were assembled. And yet not so&#13;
         many, nor so fair, as when Thangorodrim was broken, and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not so.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You remember?’ said Frodo, speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment. ‘But I thought,’ he stammered as Elrond turned&#13;
         towards him, ‘I thought that the fall of Gil-galad was a long age ago.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So it was indeed,’ answered Elrond gravely. ‘But my memory reaches back even to the Elder Days. Eärendil was my sire, who&#13;
         was born in Gondolin before its fall; and my mother was Elwing, daughter of Dior, son of Lúthien of Doriath. I have seen three&#13;
         ages in the West of the world, and many defeats, and many fruitless victories.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I was the herald of Gil-galad and marched with his host. I was at the Battle of Dagorlad before the Black Gate of Mordor,&#13;
         where we had the mastery: for the Spear of Gil-galad and the Sword of Elendil, Aeglos and Narsil, none could withstand. I&#13;
         beheld the last combat on the slopes of Orodruin, where Gil-galad died, and Elendil fell, and Narsil broke beneath him; but&#13;
         Sauron himself was overthrown, and Isildur &#13;
         <a id="page317"/>cut the Ring from his hand with the hilt-shard of his father’s sword, and took it for his own.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At this the stranger, Boromir, broke in. ‘So that is what became of the Ring!’ he cried. ‘If ever such a tale was told in&#13;
         the South, it has long been forgotten. I have heard of the Great Ring of him that we do not name; but we believed that it&#13;
         perished from the world in the ruin of his first realm. Isildur took it! That is tidings indeed.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Alas! yes,’ said Elrond. ‘Isildur took it, as should not have been. It should have been cast then into Orodruin’s fire nigh&#13;
         at hand where it was made. But few marked what Isildur did. He alone stood by his father in that last mortal contest; and&#13;
         by Gil-galad only Círdan stood, and I. But Isildur would not listen to our counsel.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “This I will have as weregild for my father, and my brother,” he said; and therefore whether we would or no, he took it&#13;
         to treasure it. But soon he was betrayed by it to his death; and so it is named in the North Isildur’s Bane. Yet death maybe&#13;
         was better than what else might have befallen him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Only to the North did these tidings come, and only to a few. Small wonder is it that you have not heard them, Boromir. From&#13;
         the ruin of the Gladden Fields, where Isildur perished, three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering.&#13;
         One of these was Ohtar, the esquire of Isildur, who bore the shards of the sword of Elendil; and he brought them to Valandil,&#13;
         the heir of Isildur, who being but a child had remained here in Rivendell. But Narsil was broken and its light extinguished,&#13;
         and it has not yet been forged again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Fruitless did I call the victory of the Last Alliance? Not wholly so, yet it did not achieve its end. Sauron was diminished,&#13;
         but not destroyed. His Ring was lost but not unmade. The Dark Tower was broken, but its foundations were not removed; for&#13;
         they were made with the power of the Ring, and while it remains they will endure. Many Elves and many mighty Men, and many&#13;
         of their friends, had perished in the &#13;
         <a id="page318"/>war. Anárion was slain, and Isildur was slain; and Gil-galad and Elendil were no more. Never again shall there be any such&#13;
         league of Elves and Men; for Men multiply and the Firstborn decrease, and the two kindreds are estranged. And ever since that&#13;
         day the race of Númenor has decayed, and the span of their years has lessened.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘In the North after the war and the slaughter of the Gladden Fields the Men of Westernesse were diminished, and their city&#13;
         of Annúminas beside Lake Evendim fell into ruin; and the heirs of Valandil removed and dwelt at Fornost on the high North&#13;
         Downs, and that now too is desolate. Men call it Deadmen’s Dike, and they fear to tread there. For the folk of Arnor dwindled,&#13;
         and their foes devoured them, and their lordship passed, leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘In the South the realm of Gondor long endured; and for a while its splendour grew, recalling somewhat of the might of Númenor,&#13;
         ere it fell. High towers that people built, and strong places, and havens of many ships; and the winged crown of the Kings&#13;
         of Men was held in awe by folk of many tongues. Their chief city was Osgiliath, Citadel of the Stars, through the midst of&#13;
         which the River flowed. And Minas Ithil they built, Tower of the Rising Moon, eastward upon a shoulder of the Mountains of&#13;
         Shadow; and westward at the feet of the White Mountains Minas Anor they made, Tower of the Setting Sun. There in the courts&#13;
         of the King grew a white tree, from the seed of that tree which Isildur brought over the deep waters, and the seed of that&#13;
         tree before came from Eressëa, and before that out of the Uttermost West in the Day before days when the world was young.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But in the wearing of the swift years of Middle-earth the line of Meneldil son of Anárion failed, and the Tree withered,&#13;
         and the blood of the Númenóreans became mingled with that of lesser men. Then the watch upon the walls of Mordor slept, and&#13;
         dark things crept back to Gorgoroth. And on a time evil things came forth, and they took Minas Ithil and abode in it, and&#13;
         they made it into a place of dread; and it is &#13;
         <a id="page319"/>called Minas Morgul, the Tower of Sorcery. Then Minas Anor was named anew Minas Tirith, the Tower of Guard; and these two&#13;
         cities were ever at war, but Osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So it has been for many lives of men. But the Lords of Minas Tirith still fight on, defying our enemies, keeping the passage&#13;
         of the River from Argonath to the Sea. And now that part of the tale that I shall tell is drawn to its close. For in the days&#13;
         of Isildur the Ruling Ring passed out of all knowledge, and the Three were released from its dominion. But now in this latter&#13;
         day they are in peril once more, for to our sorrow the One has been found. Others shall speak of its finding, for in that&#13;
         I played small part.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">He ceased, but at once Boromir stood up, tall and proud, before them. ‘Give me leave, Master Elrond,’ said he, ‘first to say&#13;
         more of Gondor, for verily from the land of Gondor I am come. And it would be well for all to know what passes there. For&#13;
         few, I deem, know of our deeds, and therefore guess little at their peril, if we should fail at last.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Believe not that in the land of Gondor the blood of Númenor is spent, nor all its pride and dignity forgotten. By our valour&#13;
         the wild folk of the East are still restrained, and the terror of Morgul kept at bay; and thus alone are peace and freedom&#13;
         maintained in the lands behind us, bulwark of the West. But if the passages of the River should be won, what then?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yet that hour, maybe, is not now far away. The Nameless Enemy has arisen again. Smoke rises once more from Orodruin that&#13;
         we call Mount Doom. The power of the Black Land grows and we are hard beset. When the Enemy returned our folk were driven&#13;
         from Ithilien, our fair domain east of the River, though we kept a foothold there and strength of arms. But this very year,&#13;
         in the days of June, sudden war came upon us out of Mordor, and we were swept away. We were outnumbered, for Mordor has allied&#13;
         itself with the Easterlings and the cruel Haradrim; but it was not by &#13;
         <a id="page320"/>numbers that we were defeated. A power was there that we have not felt before.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Some said that it could be seen, like a great black horseman, a dark shadow under the moon. Wherever he came a madness filled&#13;
         our foes, but fear fell on our boldest, so that horse and man gave way and fled. Only a remnant of our eastern force came&#13;
         back, destroying the last bridge that still stood amid the ruins of Osgiliath.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I was in the company that held the bridge, until it was cast down behind us. Four only were saved by swimming: my brother&#13;
         and myself and two others. But still we fight on, holding all the west shores of Anduin; and those who shelter behind us give&#13;
         us praise, if ever they hear our name: much praise but little help. Only from Rohan now will any men ride to us when we call.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘In this evil hour I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues to Elrond: a hundred and ten days I have journeyed&#13;
         all alone. But I do not seek allies in war. The might of Elrond is in wisdom not in weapons, it is said. I come to ask for&#13;
         counsel and the unravelling of hard words. For on the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep;&#13;
         and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again, and once to me.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing thunder, but in the West a pale light lingered,&#13;
         and out of it I heard a voice, remote but clear, crying:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Seek for the Sword that was broken:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>In Imladris it dwells;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>There shall be counsels taken</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Stronger than Morgul-spells.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>There shall be shown a token</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>That Doom is near at hand,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>For Isildur’s Bane shall waken,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>And the Halfling forth shall stand.</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page321"/>&#13;
      <p class="p1">Of these words we could understand little, and we spoke to our father, Denethor, Lord of Minas Tirith, wise in the lore of&#13;
         Gondor. This only would he say, that Imladris was of old the name among the Elves of a far northern dale, where Elrond the&#13;
         Halfelven dwelt, greatest of lore-masters. Therefore my brother, seeing how desperate was our need, was eager to heed the&#13;
         dream and seek for Imladris; but since the way was full of doubt and danger, I took the journey upon myself. Loth was my father&#13;
         to give me leave, and long have I wandered by roads forgotten, seeking the house of Elrond, of which many had heard, but few&#13;
         knew where it lay.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘And here in the house of Elrond more shall be made clear to you,’ said Aragorn, standing up. He cast his sword upon the table&#13;
         that stood before Elrond, and the blade was in two pieces. ‘Here is the Sword that was Broken!’ he said.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And who are you, and what have you to do with Minas Tirith?’ asked Boromir, looking in wonder at the lean face of the Ranger&#13;
         and his weather-stained cloak.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He is Aragorn son of Arathorn,’ said Elrond; ‘and he is descended through many fathers from Isildur Elendil’s son of Minas&#13;
         Ithil. He is the Chief of the Dúnedain in the North, and few are now left of that folk.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!’ cried Frodo in amazement, springing to his feet, as if he expected the Ring&#13;
         to be demanded at once.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It does not belong to either of us,’ said Aragorn; ‘but it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Bring out the Ring, Frodo!’ said Gandalf solemnly. ‘The time has come. Hold it up, and then Boromir will understand the remainder&#13;
         of his riddle.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">There was a hush, and all turned their eyes on Frodo. He was shaken by a sudden shame and fear; and he felt a great reluctance&#13;
         to reveal the Ring, and a loathing of its touch. He wished he was far away. The Ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up&#13;
         before them in his trembling hand.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page322"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Behold Isildur’s Bane!’ said Elrond.</p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir’s eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. ‘The Halfling!’ he muttered. ‘Is then the doom of Minas Tirith come&#13;
         at last? But why then should we seek a broken sword?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The words were not <em>the doom of Minas Tirith</em>,’ said Aragorn. ‘But doom and great deeds are indeed at hand. For the Sword that was Broken is the Sword of Elendil that&#13;
         broke beneath him when he fell. It has been treasured by his heirs when all other heirlooms were lost; for it was spoken of&#13;
         old among us that it should be made again when the Ring, Isildur’s Bane, was found. Now you have seen the sword that you have&#13;
         sought, what would you ask? Do you wish for the House of Elendil to return to the Land of Gondor?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of a riddle,’ answered Boromir proudly. ‘Yet we are hard pressed,&#13;
         and the Sword of Elendil would be a help beyond our hope – if such a thing could indeed return out of the shadows of the past.’&#13;
         He looked again at Aragorn, and doubt was in his eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo felt Bilbo stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed on his friend’s behalf. Standing suddenly up he burst&#13;
         out:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>All that is gold does not glitter,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Not all those who wander are lost;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>The old that is strong does not wither,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>Deep roots are not reached by the frost.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>From the ashes a fire shall be woken,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>A light from the shadows shall spring;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Renewed shall be blade that was broken:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>The crownless again shall be king.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="p1">‘Not very good perhaps, but to the point – if you need more beyond the word of Elrond. If that was worth a journey of a hundred&#13;
         and ten days to hear, you had best listen to it.’ He sat down with a snort.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I made that up myself,’ he whispered to Frodo, ‘for the</p>&#13;
      <a id="page323"/>&#13;
      <p>Dúnadan, a long time ago when he first told me about himself. I almost wish that my adventures were not over, and that I could&#13;
         go with him when his day comes.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Aragorn smiled at him; then he turned to Boromir again. ‘For my part I forgive your doubt,’ he said. ‘Little do I resemble&#13;
         the figures of Elendil and Isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of Denethor. I am but the heir of Isildur,&#13;
         not Isildur himself. I have had a hard life and a long; and the leagues that lie between here and Gondor are a small part&#13;
         in the count of my journeys. I have crossed many mountains and many rivers, and trodden many plains, even into the far countries&#13;
         of Rhûn and Harad where the stars are strange.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But my home, such as I have, is in the North. For here the heirs of Valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father&#13;
         unto son for many generations. Our days have darkened, and we have dwindled; but ever the Sword has passed to a new keeper.&#13;
         And this I will say to you, Boromir, ere I end. Lonely men are we, Rangers of the wild, hunters – but hunters ever of the&#13;
         servants of the Enemy; for they are found in many places, not in Mordor only.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If Gondor, Boromir, has been a stalwart tower, we have played another part. Many evil things there are that your strong walls&#13;
         and bright swords do not stay. You know little of the lands beyond your bounds. Peace and freedom, do you say? The North would&#13;
         have known them little but for us. Fear would have destroyed them. But when dark things come from the houseless hills, or&#13;
         creep from sunless woods, they fly from us. What roads would any dare to tread, what safety would there be in quiet lands,&#13;
         or in the homes of simple men at night, if the Dúnedain were asleep, or were all gone into the grave?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And yet less thanks have we than you. Travellers scowl at us, and countrymen give us scornful names. “Strider” I am to one&#13;
         fat man who lives within a day’s march of foes that would freeze his heart, or lay his little town in ruin, if he were not&#13;
         guarded ceaselessly. Yet we would not have it otherwise.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page324"/>&#13;
      <p>If simple folk are free from care and fear, simple they will be, and we must be secret to keep them so. That has been the&#13;
         task of my kindred, while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But now the world is changing once again. A new hour comes. Isildur’s Bane is found. Battle is at hand. The Sword shall be&#13;
         reforged. I will come to Minas Tirith.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Isildur’s Bane is found, you say,’ said Boromir. ‘I have seen a bright ring in the Halfling’s hand; but Isildur perished&#13;
         ere this age of the world began, they say. How do the Wise know that this ring is his? And how has it passed down the years,&#13;
         until it is brought hither by so strange a messenger?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That shall be told,’ said Elrond.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘But not yet, I beg, Master!’ cried Bilbo. ‘Already the Sun is climbing to noon, and I feel the need of something to strengthen&#13;
         me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I had not named you,’ said Elrond smiling. ‘But I do so now. Come! Tell us your tale. And if you have not yet cast your story&#13;
         into verse, you may tell it in plain words. The briefer, the sooner shall you be refreshed.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very well,’ said Bilbo. ‘I will do as you bid. But I will now tell the true story, and if some here have heard me tell it&#13;
         otherwise’ – he looked sidelong at Glóin – ‘I ask them to forget it and forgive me. I only wished to claim the treasure as&#13;
         my very own in those days, and to be rid of the name of thief that was put on me. But perhaps I understand things a little&#13;
         better now. Anyway, this is what happened.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">To some there Bilbo’s tale was wholly new, and they listened with amazement while the old hobbit, actually not at all displeased,&#13;
         recounted his adventure with Gollum, at full length. He did not omit a single riddle. He would have given also an account&#13;
         of his party and disappearance from the Shire, if he had been allowed; but Elrond raised his hand.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well told, my friend,’ he said, ‘but that is enough at this time. For the moment it suffices to know that the Ring passed&#13;
         to Frodo, your heir. Let him now speak!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page325"/>&#13;
      <p>Then, less willingly than Bilbo, Frodo told of all his dealings with the Ring from the day that it passed into his keeping.&#13;
         Every step of his journey from Hobbiton to the Ford of Bruinen was questioned and considered, and everything that he could&#13;
         recall concerning the Black Riders was examined. At last he sat down again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not bad,’ Bilbo said to him. ‘You would have made a good story of it, if they hadn’t kept on interrupting. I tried to make&#13;
         a few notes, but we shall have to go over it all again together some time, if I am to write it up. There are whole chapters&#13;
         of stuff before you ever got here!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, it made quite a long tale,’ answered Frodo. ‘But the story still does not seem complete to me. I still want to know&#13;
         a good deal, especially about Gandalf.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Galdor of the Havens, who sat nearby, overheard him. ‘You speak for me also,’ he cried, and turning to Elrond he said: ‘The&#13;
         Wise may have good reason to believe that the halfling’s trove is indeed the Great Ring of long debate, unlikely though that&#13;
         may seem to those who know less. But may we not hear the proofs? And I would ask this also. What of Saruman? He is learned&#13;
         in the lore of the Rings, yet he is not among us. What is his counsel – if he knows the things that we have heard?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The questions that you ask, Galdor, are bound together,’ said Elrond. ‘I had not overlooked them, and they shall be answered.&#13;
         But these things it is the part of Gandalf to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is the place of honour, and in&#13;
         all this matter he has been the chief.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Some, Galdor,’ said Gandalf, ‘would think the tidings of Glóin, and the pursuit of Frodo, proof enough that the halfling’s&#13;
         trove is a thing of great worth to the Enemy. Yet it is a ring. What then? The Nine the Nazgûl keep. The Seven are taken or&#13;
         destroyed.’ At this Glóin stirred, but did not speak. ‘The Three we know of. What then is this one that he desires so much?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is indeed a wide waste of time between the River &#13;
         <a id="page326"/>and the Mountain, between the loss and the finding. But the gap in the knowledge of the Wise has been filled at last. Yet&#13;
         too slowly. For the Enemy has been close behind, closer even than I feared. And well is it that not until this year, this&#13;
         very summer, as it seems, did he learn the full truth.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Some here will remember that many years ago I myself dared to pass the doors of the Necromancer in Dol Guldur, and secretly&#13;
         explored his ways, and found thus that our fears were true: he was none other than Sauron, our Enemy of old, at length taking&#13;
         shape and power again. Some, too, will remember also that Saruman dissuaded us from open deeds against him, and for long we&#13;
         watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow grew, Saruman yielded, and the Council put forth its strength and drove the evil&#13;
         out of Mirkwood – and that was in the very year of the finding of this Ring: a strange chance, if chance it was.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But we were too late, as Elrond foresaw. Sauron also had watched us, and had long prepared against our stroke, governing&#13;
         Mordor from afar through Minas Morgul, where his Nine servants dwelt, until all was ready. Then he gave way before us, but&#13;
         only feigned to flee, and soon after came to the Dark Tower and openly declared himself. Then for the last time the Council&#13;
         met; for now we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the One. We feared then that he had some news of it that&#13;
         we knew nothing of. But Saruman said nay, and repeated what he had said to us before: that the One would never again be found&#13;
         in Middle-earth.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “At the worst,” said he, “our Enemy knows that we have it not, and that it still is lost. But what was lost may yet be found,&#13;
         he thinks. Fear not! His hope will cheat him. Have I not earnestly studied this matter? Into Anduin the Great it fell; and&#13;
         long ago, while Sauron slept, it was rolled down the River to the Sea. There let it lie until the End.” ’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Gandalf fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the Misty Mountains, at whose great roots the peril&#13;
         of the world had so long lain hidden. He sighed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page327"/>&#13;
      <p>‘There I was at fault,’ he said. ‘I was lulled by the words of Saruman the Wise; but I should have sought for the truth sooner,&#13;
         and our peril would now be less.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We were all at fault,’ said Elrond, ‘and but for your vigilance the Darkness, maybe, would already be upon us. But say on!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘From the first my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,’ said Gandalf, ‘and I desired to know how this thing&#13;
         came to Gollum, and how long he had possessed it. So I set a watch for him, guessing that he would ere long come forth from&#13;
         his darkness to seek for his treasure. He came, but he escaped and was not found. And then alas! I let the matter rest, watching&#13;
         and waiting only, as we have too often done.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Time passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear. Whence came the hobbit’s ring? What, if&#13;
         my fear was true, should be done with it? Those things I must decide. But I spoke yet of my dread to none, knowing the peril&#13;
         of an untimely whisper, if it went astray. In all the long wars with the Dark Tower treason has ever been our greatest foe.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That was seventeen years ago. Soon I became aware that spies of many sorts, even beasts and birds, were gathered round the&#13;
         Shire, and my fear grew. I called for the help of the Dúnedain, and their watch was doubled; and I opened my heart to Aragorn,&#13;
         the heir of Isildur.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And I,’ said Aragorn, ‘counselled that we should hunt for Gollum, too late though it may seem. And since it seemed fit that&#13;
         Isildur’s heir should labour to repair Isildur’s fault, I went with Gandalf on the long and hopeless search.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then Gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of Wilderland, down even to the Mountains of Shadow and the fences&#13;
         of Mordor. ‘There we had rumour of him, and we guess that he dwelt there long in the dark hills; but we never found him, and&#13;
         at last I despaired. And then in my despair I thought again of a test that might make the finding of Gollum unneeded. The&#13;
         ring itself might tell if it were the One. The memory of words at the Council came back to me: words of&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page328"/>&#13;
      <p>Saruman, half-heeded at the time. I heard them now clearly in my heart.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “The Nine, the Seven, and the Three,” he said, “had each their proper gem. Not so the One. It was round and unadorned, as&#13;
         it were one of the lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could still see and read.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What those marks were he had not said. Who now would know? The maker. And Saruman? But great though his lore may be, it must&#13;
         have a source. What hand save Sauron’s ever held this thing, ere it was lost? The hand of Isildur alone.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to Gondor. In former days the members of my order had been well&#13;
         received there, but Saruman most of all. Often he had been for long the guest of the Lords of the City. Less welcome did the&#13;
         Lord Denethor show me then than of old, and grudgingly he permitted me to search among his hoarded scrolls and books.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of ancient days, and the beginnings of the City, read on!” he said. “For&#13;
         to me what was is less dark than what is to come, and that is my care. But unless you have more skill even than Saruman, who&#13;
         has studied here long, you will find naught that is not well known to me, who am master of the lore of this City.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So said Denethor. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few even of the lore-masters now can read, for their&#13;
         scripts and tongues have become dark to later men. And Boromir, there lies in Minas Tirith still, unread, I guess, by any&#13;
         save Saruman and myself since the kings failed, a scroll that Isildur made himself. For Isildur did not march away straight&#13;
         from the war in Mordor, as some have told the tale.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Some in the North, maybe,’ Boromir broke in. ‘All know in Gondor that he went first to Minas Anor and dwelt a while with&#13;
         his nephew Meneldil, instructing him, before he committed to him the rule of the South Kingdom. In that time he planted there&#13;
         the last sapling of the White Tree in memory of his brother.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But in that time also he made this scroll,’ said Gandalf;</p>&#13;
      <a id="page329"/>&#13;
      <p>‘and that is not remembered in Gondor, it would seem. For this scroll concerns the Ring, and thus wrote Isildur therein:</p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-4"><em>The Great Ring shall go now to be an heirloom of the North Kingdom; but records of it shall be left in Gondor, where also&#13;
            dwell the heirs of Elendil, lest a time come when the memory of these great matters shall grow dim.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="p1">‘And after these words Isildur described the Ring, such as he found it.</p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-4"><em>It was hot when I first took it, hot as a glede, and my hand was scorched, so that I doubt if ever again I shall be free of&#13;
            the pain of it. Yet even as I write it is cooled, and it seemeth to shrink, though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shape.&#13;
            Already the writing upon it, which at first was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is now only barely to be read. It is fashioned&#13;
            in an elven-script of Eregion, for they have no letters in Mordor for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me.&#13;
            I deem it to be a tongue of the Black Land, since it is foul and uncouth. What evil it saith I do not know; but I trace here&#13;
            a copy of it, lest it fade beyond recall. The Ring misseth, maybe, the heat of Sauron’s hand, which was black and yet burned&#13;
            like fire, and so Gil-galad was destroyed; and maybe were the gold made hot again, the writing would be refreshed. But for&#13;
            my part I will risk no hurt to this thing: of all the works of Sauron the only fair. It is precious to me, though I buy it&#13;
            with great pain.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>‘When I read these words, my quest was ended. For the traced writing was indeed as Isildur guessed, in the tongue of Mordor&#13;
         and the servants of the Tower. And what was said therein was already known. For in the day that Sauron first put on the One,&#13;
         Celebrimbor, maker of the Three, was aware of him, and from afar he heard him speak these words, and so his evil purposes&#13;
         were revealed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page330"/>&#13;
      <p>‘At once I took my leave of Denethor, but even as I went northwards, messages came to me out of Lórien that Aragorn had passed&#13;
         that way, and that he had found the creature called Gollum. Therefore I went first to meet him and hear his tale. Into what&#13;
         deadly perils he had gone alone I dared not guess.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is little need to tell of them,’ said Aragorn. ‘If a man must needs walk in sight of the Black Gate, or tread the deadly&#13;
         flowers of Morgul Vale, then perils he will have. I, too, despaired at last, and I began my homeward journey. And then, by&#13;
         fortune, I came suddenly on what I sought: the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool. But now the trail was fresh and swift,&#13;
         and it led not to Mordor but away. Along the skirts of the Dead Marshes I followed it, and then I had him. Lurking by a stagnant&#13;
         mere, peering in the water as the dark eve fell, I caught him, Gollum. He was covered with green slime. He will never love&#13;
         me, I fear; for he bit me, and I was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his mouth than the marks of his teeth. I&#13;
         deemed it the worst part of all my journey, the road back, watching him day and night, making him walk before me with a halter&#13;
         on his neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of drink and food, driving him ever towards Mirkwood. I brought him there&#13;
         at last and gave him to the Elves, for we had agreed that this should be done; and I was glad to be rid of his company, for&#13;
         he stank. For my part I hope never to look upon him again; but Gandalf came and endured long speech with him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, long and weary,’ said Gandalf, ‘but not without profit. For one thing, the tale he told of his loss agreed with that&#13;
         which Bilbo has now told openly for the first time; but that mattered little, since I had already guessed it. But I learned&#13;
         then first that Gollum’s ring came out of the Great River nigh to the Gladden Fields. And I learned also that he had possessed&#13;
         it long. Many lives of his small kind. The power of the ring had lengthened his years far beyond their span; but that power&#13;
         only the Great Rings wield.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And if that is not proof enough, Galdor, there is the other &#13;
         <a id="page331"/>test that I spoke of. Upon this very ring which you have here seen held aloft, round and unadorned, the letters that Isildur&#13;
         reported may still be read, if one has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a while. That I have done,&#13;
         and this I have read:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="dt4"><em>Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.’</em></p>&#13;
      <p>The change in the wizard’s voice was astounding. Suddenly it became menacing, powerful, harsh as stone. A shadow seemed to&#13;
         pass over the high sun, and the porch for a moment grew dark. All trembled, and the Elves stopped their ears.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Never before has any voice dared to utter words of that tongue in Imladris, Gandalf the Grey,’ said Elrond, as the shadow&#13;
         passed and the company breathed once more.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And let us hope that none will ever speak it here again,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Nonetheless I do not ask your pardon, Master&#13;
         Elrond. For if that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the West, then let all put doubt aside that this thing&#13;
         is indeed what the Wise have declared: the treasure of the Enemy, fraught with all his malice; and in it lies a great part&#13;
         of his strength of old. Out of the Black Years come the words that the Smiths of Eregion heard, and knew that they had been&#13;
         betrayed:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="dt4"><em>One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the Darkness bind them.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>‘Know also, my friends, that I learned more yet from Gollum. He was loth to speak and his tale was unclear, but it is beyond&#13;
         all doubt that he went to Mordor, and there all that he knew was forced from him. Thus the Enemy knows now that the One is&#13;
         found, that it was long in the Shire; and since his servants have pursued it almost to our door, he soon &#13;
         <a id="page332"/>will know, already he may know, even as I speak, that we have it here.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">All sat silent for a while, until at length Boromir spoke. ‘He is a small thing, you say, this Gollum? Small, but great in&#13;
         mischief. What became of him? To what doom did you put him?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He is in prison, but no worse,’ said Aragorn. ‘He had suffered much. There is no doubt that he was tormented, and the fear&#13;
         of Sauron lies black on his heart. Still I for one am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful Elves of Mirkwood. His malice&#13;
         is great and gives him a strength hardly to be believed in one so lean and withered. He could work much mischief still, if&#13;
         he were free. And I do not doubt that he was allowed to leave Mordor on some evil errand.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Alas! alas!’ cried Legolas, and in his fair Elvish face there was great distress. ‘The tidings that I was sent to bring must&#13;
         now be told. They are not good, but only here have I learned how evil they may seem to this company. Sméagol, who is now called&#13;
         Gollum, has escaped.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Escaped?’ cried Aragorn. ‘That is ill news indeed. We shall all rue it bitterly, I fear. How came the folk of Thranduil to&#13;
         fail in their trust?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not through lack of watchfulness,’ said Legolas; ‘but perhaps through over-kindliness. And we fear that the prisoner had&#13;
         aid from others, and that more is known of our doings than we could wish. We guarded this creature day and night, at Gandalf&#13;
         ’s bidding, much though we wearied of the task. But Gandalf bade us hope still for his cure, and we had not the heart to keep&#13;
         him ever in dungeons under the earth, where he would fall back into his old black thoughts.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You were less tender to me,’ said Glóin with a flash of his eyes, as old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the&#13;
         deep places of the Elven-king’s halls.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now come!’ said Gandalf. ‘Pray, do not interrupt, my good Glóin. That was a regrettable misunderstanding, long set right.&#13;
         If all the grievances that stand between Elves and&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page333"/>&#13;
      <p>Dwarves are to be brought up here, we may as well abandon this Council.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Glóin rose and bowed, and Legolas continued. ‘In the days of fair weather we led Gollum through the woods; and there was a&#13;
         high tree standing alone far from the others which he liked to climb. Often we let him mount up to the highest branches, until&#13;
         he felt the free wind; but we set a guard at the tree’s foot. One day he refused to come down, and the guards had no mind&#13;
         to climb after him: he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as well as with his hands; so they sat by&#13;
         the tree far into the night.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was that very night of summer, yet moonless and starless, that Orcs came on us at unawares. We drove them off after some&#13;
         time; they were many and fierce, but they came from over the mountains, and were unused to the woods. When the battle was&#13;
         over, we found that Gollum was gone, and his guards were slain or taken. It then seemed plain to us that the attack had been&#13;
         made for his rescue, and that he knew of it beforehand. How that was contrived we cannot guess; but Gollum is cunning, and&#13;
         the spies of the Enemy are many. The dark things that were driven out in the year of the Dragon’s fall have returned in greater&#13;
         numbers, and Mirkwood is again an evil place, save where our realm is maintained.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We have failed to recapture Gollum. We came on his trail among those of many Orcs, and it plunged deep into the Forest, going&#13;
         south. But ere long it escaped our skill, and we dared not continue the hunt; for we were drawing nigh to Dol Guldur, and&#13;
         that is still a very evil place; we do not go that way.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, well, he is gone,’ said Gandalf. ‘We have no time to seek for him again. He must do what he will. But he may play a&#13;
         part yet that neither he nor Sauron have foreseen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And now I will answer Galdor’s other questions. What of Saruman? What are his counsels to us in this need? This tale I must&#13;
         tell in full, for only Elrond has heard it yet, and that in brief; but it will bear on all that we must resolve. It is the&#13;
         last chapter in the Tale of the Ring, so far as it has yet gone.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page334"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘At the end of June I was in the Shire, but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind, and I rode to the southern borders of the little&#13;
         land; for I had a foreboding of some danger, still hidden from me but drawing near. There messages reached me telling me of&#13;
         war and defeat in Gondor, and when I heard of the Black Shadow a chill smote my heart. But I found nothing save a few fugitives&#13;
         from the South; yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they would not speak. I turned then east and north and&#13;
         journeyed along the Greenway; and not far from Bree I came upon a traveller sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing&#13;
         horse beside him. It was Radagast the Brown, who at one time dwelt at Rhosgobel, near the borders of Mirkwood. He is one of&#13;
         my order, but I had not seen him for many a year.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Gandalf!” he cried. “I was seeking you. But I am a stranger in these parts. All I knew was that you might be found in&#13;
         a wild region with the uncouth name of Shire.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Your information was correct,” I said. “But do not put it that way, if you meet any of the inhabitants. You are near the&#13;
         borders of the Shire now. And what do you want with me? It must be pressing. You were never a traveller, unless driven by&#13;
         great need.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “I have an urgent errand,” he said. “My news is evil.” Then he looked about him, as if the hedges might have ears. “Nazgûl,”&#13;
         he whispered. “The Nine are abroad again. They have crossed the River secretly and are moving westward. They have taken the&#13;
         guise of riders in black.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it. ‘ “The Enemy must have some great need or purpose,” said Radagast; “but&#13;
         what it is that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts, I cannot guess.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “What do you mean?” said I.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “I have been told that wherever they go the Riders ask for news of a land called Shire.”</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “<em>The</em> Shire,” I said; but my heart sank. For even the Wise might fear to withstand the Nine, when they are gathered together under&#13;
         their fell chieftain. A great king and sorcerer &#13;
         <a id="page335"/>he was of old, and now he wields a deadly fear. “Who told you, and who sent you?” I asked.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Saruman the White,” answered Radagast. “And he told me to say that if you feel the need, he will help; but you must seek&#13;
         his aid at once, or it will be too late.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And that message brought me hope. For Saruman the White is the greatest of my order. Radagast is, of course, a worthy Wizard,&#13;
         a master of shapes and changes of hue; and he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and birds are especially his friends. But&#13;
         Saruman has long studied the arts of the Enemy himself, and thus we have often been able to forestall him. It was by the devices&#13;
         of Saruman that we drove him from Dol Guldur. It might be that he had found some weapons that would drive back the Nine.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “I will go to Saruman,” I said.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Then you must go <em>now</em>,” said Radagast; “for I have wasted time in looking for you, and the days are running short. I was told to find you before&#13;
         Midsummer, and that is now here. Even if you set out from this spot, you will hardly reach him before the Nine discover the&#13;
         land that they seek. I myself shall turn back at once.” And with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Stay a moment!” I said. “We shall need your help, and the help of all things that will give it. Send out messages to all&#13;
         the beasts and birds that are your friends. Tell them to bring news of anything that bears on this matter to Saruman and Gandalf.&#13;
         Let messages be sent to Orthanc.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “I will do that,” he said, and rode off as if the Nine were after him.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘I could not follow him then and there. I had ridden very far already that day, and I was as weary as my horse; and I needed&#13;
         to consider matters. I stayed the night in Bree, and decided that I had no time to return to the Shire. Never did I make a&#13;
         greater mistake!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘However, I wrote a message to Frodo, and trusted to my friend the innkeeper to send it to him. I rode away at dawn; &#13;
         <a id="page336"/>and I came at long last to the dwelling of Saruman. That is far south in Isengard, in the end of the Misty Mountains, not&#13;
         far from the Gap of Rohan. And Boromir will tell you that that is a great open vale that lies between the Misty Mountains&#13;
         and the northmost foothills of Ered Nimrais, the White Mountains of his home. But Isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that&#13;
         enclose a valley as with a wall, and in the midst of that valley is a tower of stone called Orthanc. It was not made by Saruman,&#13;
         but by the Men of Númenor long ago; and it is very tall and has many secrets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft. It cannot&#13;
         be reached save by passing the circle of Isengard; and in that circle there is only one gate.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall of rock; and it was strongly guarded. But the keepers&#13;
         of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode under the arch, and the gate closed silently&#13;
         behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though I knew no reason for it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But I rode to the foot of Orthanc, and came to the stair of Saruman; and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber.&#13;
         He wore a ring on his finger.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “So you have come, Gandalf,” he said to me gravely; but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light, as if a cold laughter&#13;
         was in his heart.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Yes, I have come,” I said. “I have come for your aid, Saruman the White.” And that title seemed to anger him.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Have you indeed, Gandalf the <em>Grey</em>!” he scoffed. “For aid? It has seldom been heard of that Gandalf the Grey sought for aid, one so cunning and so wise, wandering&#13;
         about the lands, and concerning himself in every business, whether it belongs to him or not.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I looked at him and wondered. “But if I am not deceived,” said I, “things are now moving which will require the union of&#13;
         all our strength.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “That may be so,” he said, “but the thought is late in coming to you. How long, I wonder, have you concealed from me, the&#13;
         head of the Council, a matter of greatest import?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page337"/>&#13;
      <p>What brings you now from your lurking-place in the Shire?”</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “The Nine have come forth again,” I answered. “They have crossed the River. So Radagast said to me.”</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Radagast the Brown!” laughed Saruman, and he no longer concealed his scorn. “Radagast the Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple!&#13;
         Radagast the Fool! Yet he had just the wit to play the part that I set him. For you have come, and that was all the purpose&#13;
         of my message. And here you will stay, Gandalf the Grey, and rest from journeys. For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker,&#13;
         Saruman of Many Colours!”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not so, but were woven of all colours, and if he moved&#13;
         they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye was bewildered.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “I liked white better,” I said.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “White!” he sneered. “It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be dyed. The white page can be overwritten; and the white&#13;
         light can be broken.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “In which case it is no longer white,” said I. “And he that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom.”</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “You need not speak to me as to one of the fools that you take for friends,” said he. “I have not brought you hither to&#13;
         be instructed by you, but to give you a choice.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He drew himself up then and began to declaim, as if he were making a speech long rehearsed. “The Elder Days are gone. The&#13;
         Middle Days are passing. The Younger Days are beginning. The time of the Elves is over, but our time is at hand: the world&#13;
         of Men, which we must rule. But we must have power, power to order all things as we will, for that good which only the Wise&#13;
         can see.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “And listen, Gandalf, my old friend and helper!” he said, coming near and speaking now in a softer voice. “I said <em>we</em>, for <em>we</em> it may be, if you will join with me. A new Power is rising. Against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all.&#13;
         There is no hope left in Elves or dying Númenor. This then is one choice before you, before us. We may join with &#13;
         <a id="page338"/>that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those&#13;
         that aided it. As the Power grows, its proved friends will also grow; and the Wise, such as you and I, may with patience come&#13;
         at last to direct its courses, to control it. We can bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deploring maybe&#13;
         evils done by the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose: Knowledge, Rule, Order; all the things that we have so&#13;
         far striven in vain to accomplish, hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends. There need not be, there would&#13;
         not be, any real change in our designs, only in our means.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Saruman,” I said, “I have heard speeches of this kind before, but only in the mouths of emissaries sent from Mordor to&#13;
         deceive the ignorant. I cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He looked at me sidelong, and paused a while considering. “Well, I see that this wise course does not commend itself to you,”&#13;
         he said. “Not yet? Not if some better way can be contrived?”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He came and laid his long hand on my arm. “And why not, Gandalf?” he whispered. “Why not? The Ruling Ring? If we could command&#13;
         that, then the Power would pass to <em>us</em>. That is in truth why I brought you here. For I have many eyes in my service, and I believe that you know where this precious&#13;
         thing now lies. Is it not so? Or why do the Nine ask for the Shire, and what is your business there?” As he said this a lust&#13;
         which he could not conceal shone suddenly in his eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Saruman,” I said, standing away from him, “only one hand at a time can wield the One, and you know that well, so do not&#13;
         trouble to say <em>we</em>! But I would not give it, nay, I would not give even news of it to you, now that I learn your mind. You were head of the&#13;
         Council, but you have unmasked yourself at last. Well, the choices are, it seems, to submit to Sauron, or to yourself. I will&#13;
         take neither. Have you others to offer?”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page339"/>&#13;
      <p>‘He was cold now and perilous. “Yes,” he said. “I did not expect you to show wisdom, even in your own behalf; but I gave you&#13;
         the chance of aiding me willingly, and so saving yourself much trouble and pain. The third choice is to stay here, until the&#13;
         end.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Until what end?”</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Until you reveal to me where the One may be found. I may find means to persuade you. Or until it is found in your despite,&#13;
         and the Ruler has time to turn to lighter matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of Gandalf&#13;
         the Grey.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “That may not prove to be one of the lighter matters,” said I. He laughed at me, for my words were empty, and he knew it.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘They took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of Orthanc, in the place where Saruman was accustomed to watch the stars.&#13;
         There is no descent save by a narrow stair of many thousand steps, and the valley below seems far away. I looked on it and&#13;
         saw that, whereas it had once been green and fair, it was now filled with pits and forges. Wolves and orcs were housed in&#13;
         Isengard, for Saruman was mustering a great force on his own account, in rivalry of Sauron and not in his service, yet. Over&#13;
         all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of Orthanc. I stood alone on an island in the clouds; and&#13;
         I had no chance of escape, and my days were bitter. I was pierced with cold, and I had but little room in which to pace to&#13;
         and fro, brooding on the coming of the Riders to the North.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That the Nine had indeed arisen I felt assured, apart from the words of Saruman which might be lies. Long ere I came to Isengard&#13;
         I had heard tidings by the way that could not be mistaken. Fear was ever in my heart for my friends in the Shire; but still&#13;
         I had some hope. I hoped that Frodo had set forth at once, as my letter had urged, and that he had reached Rivendell before&#13;
         the deadly pursuit began. And both my fear and my hope proved ill-founded. For my hope was founded &#13;
         <a id="page340"/>on a fat man in Bree; and my fear was founded on the cunning of Sauron. But fat men who sell ale have many calls to answer;&#13;
         and the power of Sauron is still less than fear makes it. But in the circle of Isengard, trapped and alone, it was not easy&#13;
         to think that the hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the Shire far away.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I saw you!’ cried Frodo. ‘You were walking backwards and forwards. The moon shone in your hair.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf paused astonished and looked at him. ‘It was only a dream,’ said Frodo, ‘but it suddenly came back to me. I had quite&#13;
         forgotten it. It came some time ago; after I left the Shire, I think.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then it was late in coming,’ said Gandalf, ‘as you will see. I was in an evil plight. And those who know me will agree that&#13;
         I have seldom been in such need, and do not bear such misfortune well. Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider’s treacherous&#13;
         web! Yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘At first I feared, as Saruman no doubt intended, that Radagast had also fallen. Yet I had caught no hint of anything wrong&#13;
         in his voice or in his eye at our meeting. If I had, I should never have gone to Isengard, or I should have gone more warily.&#13;
         So Saruman guessed, and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger. It would have been useless in any case to try&#13;
         and win over the honest Radagast to treachery. He sought me in good faith, and so persuaded me.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That was the undoing of Saruman’s plot. For Radagast knew no reason why he should not do as I asked; and he rode away towards&#13;
         Mirkwood where he had many friends of old. And the Eagles of the Mountains went far and wide, and they saw many things: the&#13;
         gathering of wolves and the mustering of Orcs; and the Nine Riders going hither and thither in the lands; and they heard news&#13;
         of the escape of Gollum. And they sent a messenger to bring these tidings to me.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So it was that when summer waned, there came a night of moon, and Gwaihir the Windlord, swiftest of the Great <a id="page341"/>Eagles, came unlooked-for to Orthanc; and he found me standing on the pinnacle. Then I spoke to him and he bore me away, before&#13;
         Saruman was aware. I was far from Isengard, ere the wolves and orcs issued from the gate to pursue me.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “How far can you bear me?” I said to Gwaihir. ‘ “Many leagues,” said he, “but not to the ends of the earth. I was sent to&#13;
         bear tidings not burdens.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Then I must have a steed on land,” I said, “and a steed surpassingly swift, for I have never had such need of haste before.”</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Then I will bear you to Edoras, where the Lord of Rohan sits in his halls,” he said; “for that is not very far off.” And&#13;
         I was glad, for in the Riddermark of Rohan the Rohirrim, the Horse-lords, dwell, and there are no horses like those that are&#13;
         bred in that great vale between the Misty Mountains and the White.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Are the Men of Rohan still to be trusted, do you think?” I said to Gwaihir, for the treason of Saruman had shaken my faith.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “They pay a tribute of horses,” he answered, “and send many yearly to Mordor, or so it is said; but they are not yet under&#13;
         the yoke. But if Saruman has become evil, as you say, then their doom cannot be long delayed.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘He set me down in the land of Rohan ere dawn; and now I have lengthened my tale over long. The rest must be more brief. In&#13;
         Rohan I found evil already at work: the lies of Saruman; and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings. He bade&#13;
         me take a horse and be gone; and I chose one much to my liking, but little to his. I took the best horse in his land, and&#13;
         I have never seen the like of him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then he must be a noble beast indeed,’ said Aragorn; ‘and it grieves me more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn&#13;
         that Sauron levies such tribute. It was not so when last I was in that land.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Nor is it now, I will swear,’ said Boromir. ‘It is a lie that comes from the Enemy. I know the Men of Rohan, true and &#13;
         <a id="page342"/>valiant, our allies, dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The shadow of Mordor lies on distant lands,’ answered Aragorn. ‘Saruman has fallen under it. Rohan is beset. Who knows what&#13;
         you will find there, if ever you return?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not this at least,’ said Boromir, ‘that they will buy their lives with horses. They love their horses next to their kin.&#13;
         And not without reason, for the horses of the Riddermark come from the fields of the North, far from the Shadow, and their&#13;
         race, as that of their masters, is descended from the free days of old.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘True indeed!’ said Gandalf. ‘And there is one among them that might have been foaled in the morning of the world. The horses&#13;
         of the Nine cannot vie with him; tireless, swift as the flowing wind. Shadowfax they called him. By day his coat glistens&#13;
         like silver; and by night it is like a shade, and he passes unseen. Light is his footfall! Never before had any man mounted&#13;
         him, but I took him and I tamed him, and so speedily he bore me that I reached the Shire when Frodo was on the Barrow-downs,&#13;
         though I set out from Rohan only when he set out from Hobbiton.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But fear grew in me as I rode. Ever as I came north I heard tidings of the Riders, and though I gained on them day by day,&#13;
         they were ever before me. They had divided their forces, I learned: some remained on the eastern borders, not far from the&#13;
         Greenway, and some invaded the Shire from the south. I came to Hobbiton and Frodo had gone; but I had words with old Gamgee.&#13;
         Many words and few to the point. He had much to say about the shortcomings of the new owners of Bag End.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “I can’t abide changes,” said he, “not at my time of life, and least of all changes for the worst.” “Changes for the worst,”&#13;
         he repeated many times.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Worst is a bad word,” I said to him, “and I hope you do not live to see it.” But amidst his talk I gathered at last that&#13;
         Frodo had left Hobbiton less than a week before, and that a black horseman had come to the Hill the same evening. Then&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page343"/>&#13;
      <p>I rode on in fear. I came to Buckland and found it in uproar, as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with a stick.&#13;
         I came to the house at Crickhollow, and it was broken open and empty; but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been&#13;
         Frodo’s. Then for a while hope left me, and I did not wait to gather news, or I might have been comforted; but I rode on the&#13;
         trail of the Riders. It was hard to follow, for it went many ways, and I was at a loss. But it seemed to me that one or two&#13;
         had ridden towards Bree; and that way I went, for I thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Butterbur they call him,” thought I. “If this delay was his fault, I will melt all the butter in him. I will roast the&#13;
         old fool over a slow fire.” He expected no less, and when he saw my face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What did you do to him?’ cried Frodo in alarm. ‘He was really very kind to us and did all that he could.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf laughed. ‘Don’t be afraid!’ he said. ‘I did not bite, and I barked very little. So overjoyed was I by the news that&#13;
         I got out of him, when he stopped quaking, that I embraced the old fellow. How it had happened I could not then guess, but&#13;
         I learned that you had been in Bree the night before, and had gone off that morning with Strider.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Strider!” I cried, shouting for joy.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Yes, sir, I am afraid so, sir,” said Butterbur, mistaking me. “He got at them, in spite of all that I could do, and they&#13;
         took up with him. They behaved very queer all the time they were here: wilful, you might say.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘ “Ass! Fool! Thrice worthy and beloved Barliman!” said I. “It’s the best news I have had since Midsummer; it’s worth a gold&#13;
         piece at the least. May your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for seven years!” said I. “Now I can&#13;
         take a night’s rest, the first since I have forgotten when.”&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘So I stayed there that night, wondering much what had become of the Riders; for only of two had there yet been any &#13;
         <a id="page344"/>news in Bree, it seemed. But in the night we heard more. Five at least came from the west, and they threw down the gates and&#13;
         passed through Bree like a howling wind; and the Bree-folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the world. I got up&#13;
         before dawn and went after them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not know, but it seems clear to me that this is what happened. Their Captain remained in secret away south of Bree,&#13;
         while two rode ahead through the village, and four more invaded the Shire. But when these were foiled in Bree and at Crickhollow,&#13;
         they returned to their Captain with tidings, and so left the Road unguarded for a while, except by their spies. The Captain&#13;
         then sent some eastward straight across country, and he himself with the rest rode along the Road in great wrath.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I galloped to Weathertop like a gale, and I reached it before sundown on my second day from Bree – and they were there before&#13;
         me. They drew away from me, for they felt the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the Sun was in the sky.&#13;
         But they closed round at night, and I was besieged on the hill-top, in the old ring of Amon Sûl. I was hard put to it indeed:&#13;
         such light and flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the war-beacons of old.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘At sunrise I escaped and fled towards the north. I could not hope to do more. It was impossible to find you, Frodo, in the&#13;
         wilderness, and it would have been folly to try with all the Nine at my heels. So I had to trust to Aragorn. But I hoped to&#13;
         draw some of them off, and yet reach Rivendell ahead of you and send out help. Four Riders did indeed follow me, but they&#13;
         turned back after a while and made for the Ford, it seems. That helped a little, for there were only five, not nine, when&#13;
         your camp was attacked.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I reached here at last by a long hard road, up the Hoarwell and through the Ettenmoors, and down from the north. It took&#13;
         me nearly fifteen days from Weathertop, for I could not ride among the rocks of the troll-fells, and Shadowfax departed. I&#13;
         sent him back to his master; but a great friendship has grown between us, and if I have need he will come at my &#13;
         <a id="page345"/>call. But so it was that I came to Rivendell only two days before the Ring, and news of its peril had already been brought&#13;
         here – which proved well indeed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And that, Frodo, is the end of my account. May Elrond and the others forgive the length of it. But such a thing has not happened&#13;
         before, that Gandalf broke tryst and did not come when he promised. An account to the Ring-bearer of so strange an event was&#13;
         required, I think.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, the Tale is now told, from first to last. Here we all are, and here is the Ring. But we have not yet come any nearer&#13;
         to our purpose. What shall we do with it?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">There was a silence. At last Elrond spoke again.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘This is grievous news concerning Saruman,’ he said; ‘for we trusted him and he is deep in all our counsels. It is perilous&#13;
         to study too deeply the arts of the Enemy, for good or for ill. But such falls and betrayals, alas, have happened before.&#13;
         Of the tales that we have heard this day the tale of Frodo was most strange to me. I have known few hobbits, save Bilbo here;&#13;
         and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as I had thought him. The world has changed much since I last&#13;
         was on the westward roads.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Barrow-wights we know by many names; and of the Old Forest many tales have been told: all that now remains is but an&#13;
         outlier of its northern march. Time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the Shire to Dunland west&#13;
         of Isengard. In those lands I journeyed once, and many things wild and strange I knew. But I had forgotten Bombadil, if indeed&#13;
         this is still the same that walked the woods and hills long ago, and even then was older than the old. That was not then his&#13;
         name. Iarwain Ben-adar we called him, oldest and fatherless. But many another name he has since been given by other folk:&#13;
         Forn by the Dwarves, Orald by Northern Men, and other names beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summoned&#13;
         him to our Council.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He would not have come,’ said Gandalf.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page346"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help?’ asked Erestor. ‘It seems that he has a power even over the&#13;
         Ring.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, I should not put it so,’ said Gandalf. ‘Say rather that the Ring has no power over him. He is his own master. But he&#13;
         cannot alter the Ring itself, nor break its power over others. And now he is withdrawn into a little land, within bounds that&#13;
         he has set, though none can see them, waiting perhaps for a change of days, and he will not step beyond them.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him,’ said Erestor. ‘Would he not take the Ring and keep it there, for ever&#13;
         harmless?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No,’ said Gandalf, ‘not willingly. He might do so, if all the free folk of the world begged him, but he would not understand&#13;
         the need. And if he were given the Ring, he would soon forget it, or most likely throw it away. Such things have no hold on&#13;
         his mind. He would be a most unsafe guardian; and that alone is answer enough.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But in any case,’ said Glorfindel, ‘to send the Ring to him would only postpone the day of evil. He is far away. We could&#13;
         not now take it back to him, unguessed, unmarked by any spy. And even if we could, soon or late the Lord of the Rings would&#13;
         learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards it. Could that power be defied by Bombadil alone? I think not.&#13;
         I think that in the end, if all else is conquered, Bombadil will fall, Last as he was First; and then Night will come.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I know little of Iarwain save the name,’ said Galdor; ‘but Glorfindel, I think, is right. Power to defy our Enemy is not&#13;
         in him, unless such power is in the earth itself. And yet we see that Sauron can torture and destroy the very hills. What&#13;
         power still remains lies with us, here in Imladris, or with Círdan at the Havens, or in Lórien. But have they the strength,&#13;
         have we here the strength to withstand the Enemy, the coming of Sauron at the last, when all else is overthrown?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have not the strength,’ said Elrond; ‘neither have they.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then if the Ring cannot be kept from him for ever by &#13;
         <a id="page347"/>strength,’ said Glorfindel, ‘two things only remain for us to attempt: to send it over the Sea, or to destroy it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But Gandalf has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here possess,’ said Elrond. ‘And they who dwell&#13;
         beyond the Sea would not receive it: for good or ill it belongs to Middle-earth; it is for us who still dwell here to deal&#13;
         with it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then,’ said Glorfindel, ‘let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the lies of Saruman come true. For it is clear now that&#13;
         even at the Council his feet were already on a crooked path. He knew that the Ring was not lost for ever, but wished us to&#13;
         think so; for he began to lust for it for himself. Yet oft in lies truth is hidden: in the Sea it would be safe.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not safe for ever,’ said Gandalf. ‘There are many things in the deep waters; and seas and lands may change. And it is not&#13;
         our part here to take thought only for a season, or for a few lives of Men, or for a passing age of the world. We should seek&#13;
         a final end of this menace, even if we do not hope to make one.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And that we shall not find on the roads to the Sea,’ said Galdor. ‘If the return to Iarwain be thought too dangerous, then&#13;
         flight to the Sea is now fraught with gravest peril. My heart tells me that Sauron will expect us to take the western way,&#13;
         when he learns what has befallen. He soon will. The Nine have been unhorsed indeed, but that is but a respite, ere they find&#13;
         new steeds and swifter. Only the waning might of Gondor stands now between him and a march in power along the coasts into&#13;
         the North; and if he comes, assailing the White Towers and the Havens, hereafter the Elves may have no escape from the lengthening&#13;
         shadows of Middle-earth.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Long yet will that march be delayed,’ said Boromir. ‘Gondor wanes, you say. But Gondor stands, and even the end of its strength&#13;
         is still very strong.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the Nine,’ said Galdor. ‘And other roads he may find that Gondor does not guard.’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page348"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Then,’ said Erestor, ‘there are but two courses, as Glorfindel already has declared: to hide the Ring for ever; or to unmake&#13;
         it. But both are beyond our power. Who will read this riddle for us?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘None here can do so,’ said Elrond gravely. ‘At least none can foretell what will come to pass, if we take this road or that.&#13;
         But it seems to me now clear which is the road that we must take. The westward road seems easiest. Therefore it must be shunned.&#13;
         It will be watched. Too often the Elves have fled that way. Now at this last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen.&#13;
         There lies our hope, if hope it be. To walk into peril – to Mordor. We must send the Ring to the Fire.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Silence fell again. Frodo, even in that fair house, looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters,&#13;
         felt a dead darkness in his heart. Boromir stirred, and Frodo looked at him. He was fingering his great horn and frowning.&#13;
         At length he spoke.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not understand all this,’ he said. ‘Saruman is a traitor, but did he not have a glimpse of wisdom? Why do you speak&#13;
         ever of hiding and destroying? Why should we not think that the Great Ring has come into our hands to serve us in the very&#13;
         hour of need? Wielding it the Free Lords of the Free may surely defeat the Enemy. That is what he most fears, I deem.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Men of Gondor are valiant, and they will never submit; but they may be beaten down. Valour needs first strength, and&#13;
         then a weapon. Let the Ring be your weapon, if it has such power as you say. Take it and go forth to victory!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Alas, no,’ said Elrond. ‘We cannot use the Ruling Ring. That we now know too well. It belongs to Sauron and was made by him&#13;
         alone, and is altogether evil. Its strength, Boromir, is too great for anyone to wield at will, save only those who have already&#13;
         a great power of their own. But for them it holds an even deadlier peril. The very desire of it corrupts the heart. Consider&#13;
         Saruman. If any of the Wise &#13;
         <a id="page349"/>should with this Ring overthrow the Lord of Mordor, using his own arts, he would then set himself on Sauron’s throne, and&#13;
         yet another Dark Lord would appear. And that is another reason why the Ring should be destroyed: as long as it is in the world&#13;
         it will be a danger even to the Wise. For nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so. I fear to take the Ring&#13;
         to hide it. I will not take the Ring to wield it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Nor I,’ said Gandalf.</p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir looked at them doubtfully, but he bowed his head. ‘So be it,’ he said. ‘Then in Gondor we must trust to such weapons&#13;
         as we have. And at the least, while the Wise ones guard this Ring, we will fight on. Mayhap the Sword-that-was-Broken may&#13;
         still stem the tide – if the hand that wields it has inherited not an heirloom only, but the sinews of the Kings of Men.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who can tell?’ said Aragorn. ‘But we will put it to the test one day.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘May the day not be too long delayed,’ said Boromir. ‘For though I do not ask for aid, we need it. It would comfort us to&#13;
         know that others fought also with all the means that they have.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then be comforted,’ said Elrond. ‘For there are other powers and realms that you know not, and they are hidden from you.&#13;
         Anduin the Great flows past many shores, ere it comes to Argonath and the Gates of Gondor.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Still it might be well for all,’ said Glóin the Dwarf, ‘if all these strengths were joined, and the powers of each were used&#13;
         in league. Other rings there may be, less treacherous, that might be used in our need. The Seven are lost to us – if Balin&#13;
         has not found the ring of Thrór, which was the last; naught has been heard of it since Thrór perished in Moria. Indeed I may&#13;
         now reveal that it was partly in hope to find that ring that Balin went away.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Balin will find no ring in Moria,’ said Gandalf. ‘Thrór gave it to Thráin his son, but not Thráin to Thorin. It was taken&#13;
         with torment from Thráin in the dungeons of Dol Guldur. I came too late.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page350"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah, alas!’ cried Glóin. ‘When will the day come of our revenge? But still there are the Three. What of the Three Rings of&#13;
         the Elves? Very mighty Rings, it is said. Do not the Elf-lords keep them? Yet they too were made by the Dark Lord long ago.&#13;
         Are they idle? I see Elf-lords here. Will they not say?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Elves returned no answer. ‘Did you not hear me, Glóin?’ said Elrond. ‘The Three were not made by Sauron, nor did he ever&#13;
         touch them. But of them it is not permitted to speak. So much only in this hour of doubt I may now say. They are not idle.&#13;
         But they were not made as weapons of war or conquest: that is not their power. Those who made them did not desire strength&#13;
         or domination or hoarded wealth, but understanding, making, and healing, to preserve all things unstained. These things the&#13;
         Elves of Middle-earth have in some measure gained, though with sorrow. But all that has been wrought by those who wield the&#13;
         Three will turn to their undoing, and their minds and hearts will become revealed to Sauron, if he regains the One. It would&#13;
         be better if the Three had never been. That is his purpose.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But what then would happen, if the Ruling Ring were destroyed, as you counsel?’ asked Glóin.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We know not for certain,’ answered Elrond sadly. ‘Some hope that the Three Rings, which Sauron has never touched, would then&#13;
         become free, and their rulers might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought. But maybe when the One has gone, the&#13;
         Three will fail, and many fair things will fade and be forgotten. That is my belief.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yet all the Elves are willing to endure this chance,’ said Glorfindel, ‘if by it the power of Sauron may be broken, and the&#13;
         fear of his dominion be taken away for ever.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Thus we return once more to the destroying of the Ring,’ said Erestor, ‘and yet we come no nearer. What strength have we&#13;
         for the finding of the Fire in which it was made? That is the path of despair. Of folly I would say, if the long wisdom of&#13;
         Elrond did not forbid me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Despair, or folly?’ said Gandalf. ‘It is not despair, for &#13;
         <a id="page351"/>despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not. It is wisdom to recognize necessity, when all other&#13;
         courses have been weighed, though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our cloak, a&#13;
         veil before the eyes of the Enemy! For he is very wise, and weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice. But&#13;
         the only measure that he knows is desire, desire for power; and so he judges all hearts. Into his heart the thought will not&#13;
         enter that any will refuse it, that having the Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of reckoning.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘At least for a while,’ said Elrond. ‘The road must be trod, but it will be very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will&#13;
         carry us far upon it. This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course&#13;
         of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘Very well, very well, Master Elrond!’ said Bilbo suddenly. ‘Say no more! It is plain enough what you are pointing at. Bilbo&#13;
         the silly hobbit started this affair, and Bilbo had better finish it, or himself. I was very comfortable here, and getting&#13;
         on with my book. If you want to know, I am just writing an ending for it. I had thought of putting: <em>and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his days</em>. It is a good ending, and none the worse for having been used before. Now I shall have to alter that: it does not look like&#13;
         coming true; and anyway there will evidently have to be several more chapters, if I live to write them. It is a frightful&#13;
         nuisance. When ought I to start?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir looked in surprise at Bilbo, but the laughter died on his lips when he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit&#13;
         with grave respect. Only Glóin smiled, but his smile came from old memories.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of course, my dear Bilbo,’ said Gandalf. ‘If you had really started this affair, you might be expected to finish it. But&#13;
         you &#13;
         <a id="page352"/>know well enough now that <em>starting</em> is too great a claim for any, and that only a small part is played in great deeds by any hero. You need not bow! Though the&#13;
         word was meant, and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. But one beyond your strength, Bilbo. You&#13;
         cannot take this thing back. It has passed on. If you need my advice any longer, I should say that your part is ended, unless&#13;
         as a recorder. Finish your book, and leave the ending unaltered! There is still hope for it. But get ready to write a sequel,&#13;
         when they come back.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Bilbo laughed. ‘I have never known you give me pleasant advice before,’ he said. ‘As all your unpleasant advice has been good,&#13;
         I wonder if this advice is not bad. Still, I don’t suppose I have the strength or luck left to deal with the Ring. It has&#13;
         grown, and I have not. But tell me: what do you mean by <em>they</em>?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The messengers who are sent with the Ring.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Exactly! And who are they to be? That seems to me what this Council has to decide, and all that it has to decide. Elves may&#13;
         thrive on speech alone, and Dwarves endure great weariness; but I am only an old hobbit, and I miss my meal at noon. Can’t&#13;
         we think of some names now? Or put it off till after dinner?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">No one answered. The noon-bell rang. Still no one spoke. Frodo glanced at all the faces, but they were not turned to him.&#13;
         All the Council sat with downcast eyes, as if in deep thought. A great dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the pronouncement&#13;
         of some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and&#13;
         remain at peace by Bilbo’s side in Rivendell filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke, and wondered to hear his&#13;
         own words, as if some other will was using his small voice.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will take the Ring,’ he said, ‘though I do not know the way.’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page353"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Elrond raised his eyes and looked at him, and Frodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance. ‘If I understand&#13;
         aright all that I have heard,’ he said, ‘I think that this task is appointed for you, Frodo; and that if you do not find a&#13;
         way, no one will. This is the hour of the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels&#13;
         of the Great. Who of all the Wise could have foreseen it? Or, if they are wise, why should they expect to know it, until the&#13;
         hour has struck?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that none could lay it on another. I do not lay it on you. But if you take it freely,&#13;
         I will say that your choice is right; and though all the mighty Elf-friends of old, Hador, and Húrin, and Túrin, and Beren&#13;
         himself were assembled together, your seat should be among them.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But you won’t send him off alone surely, Master?’ cried Sam, unable to contain himself any longer, and jumping up from the&#13;
         corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No indeed!’ said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. ‘You at least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate&#13;
         you from him, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam sat down, blushing and muttering. ‘A nice pickle we have landed ourselves in, Mr. Frodo!’ he said, shaking his head.</p>&#13;

            <em>Chapter</em> 3</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-15">THE RING GOES SOUTH</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">Later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their own in Bilbo’s room. Merry and Pippin were indignant when they heard that&#13;
         Sam had crept into the Council, and had been chosen as Frodo’s companion.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It’s most unfair,’ said Pippin. ‘Instead of throwing him out, and clapping him in chains, Elrond goes and <em>rewards</em> him for his cheek!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Rewards!’ said Frodo. ‘I can’t imagine a more severe punishment. You are not thinking what you are saying: condemned to go&#13;
         on this hopeless journey, a reward? Yesterday I dreamed that my task was done, and I could rest here, a long while, perhaps&#13;
         for good.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t wonder,’ said Merry, ‘and I wish you could. But we are envying Sam, not you. If you have to go, then it will be a&#13;
         punishment for any of us to be left behind, even in Rivendell. We have come a long way with you and been through some stiff&#13;
         times. We want to go on.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That’s what I meant,’ said Pippin. ‘We hobbits ought to stick together, and we will. I shall go, unless they chain me up.&#13;
         There must be someone with intelligence in the party.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!’ said Gandalf, looking in through the window, which was near the ground.&#13;
         ‘But you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarily. Nothing is decided yet.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Nothing decided!’ cried Pippin. ‘Then what were you all doing? You were shut up for hours.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Talking,’ said Bilbo. ‘There was a deal of talk, and everyone had an eye-opener. Even old Gandalf. I think Legolas’s bit&#13;
         of news about Gollum caught even him on the hop, though he passed it off.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page355"/>&#13;
      <p>‘You were wrong,’ said Gandalf. ‘You were inattentive. I had already heard of it from Gwaihir. If you want to know, the only&#13;
         real eye-openers, as you put it, were you and Frodo; and I was the only one that was not surprised.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, anyway,’ said Bilbo, ‘nothing was decided beyond choosing poor Frodo and Sam. I was afraid all the time that it might&#13;
         come to that, if I was let off. But if you ask me, Elrond will send out a fair number, when the reports come in. Have they&#13;
         started yet, Gandalf?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said the wizard. ‘Some of the scouts have been sent out already. More will go tomorrow. Elrond is sending Elves, and&#13;
         they will get in touch with the Rangers, and maybe with Thranduil’s folk in Mirkwood. And Aragorn has gone with Elrond’s sons.&#13;
         We shall have to scour the lands all round for many long leagues before any move is made. So cheer up, Frodo! You will probably&#13;
         make quite a long stay here.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah!’ said Sam gloomily. ‘We’ll just wait long enough for winter to come.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That can’t be helped,’ said Bilbo. ‘It’s your fault partly, Frodo my lad: insisting on waiting for my birthday. A funny way&#13;
         of honouring it, I can’t help thinking. <em>Not</em> the day I should have chosen for letting the S.-B.s into Bag End. But there it is: you can’t wait now till spring; and you&#13;
         can’t go till the reports come back.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>When winter first begins to bite</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vex-t"><em>and stones crack in the frosty night,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>when pools are black and trees are bare,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>’tis evil in the Wild to fare.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="p1">But that I am afraid will be just your luck.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am afraid it will,’ said Gandalf. ‘We can’t start until we have found out about the Riders.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I thought they were all destroyed in the flood,’ said Merry.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You cannot destroy Ringwraiths like that,’ said Gandalf. ‘The power of their master is in them, and they stand or fall by&#13;
         him. We hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked, &#13;
         <a id="page356"/>and so made for a while less dangerous; but we must find out for certain. In the meantime you should try and forget your troubles,&#13;
         Frodo. I do not know if I can do anything to help you; but I will whisper this in your ears. Someone said that intelligence&#13;
         would be needed in the party. He was right. I think I shall come with you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>So great was Frodo’s delight at this announcement that Gandalf left the window-sill, where he had been sitting, and took off&#13;
         his hat and bowed. ‘I only said <em>I think I shall come</em>. Do not count on anything yet. In this matter Elrond will have much to say, and your friend the Strider. Which reminds me,&#13;
         I want to see Elrond. I must be off.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘How long do you think I shall have here?’ said Frodo to Bilbo when Gandalf had gone.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh, I don’t know. I can’t count days in Rivendell,’ said Bilbo. ‘But quite long, I should think. We can have many a good&#13;
         talk. What about helping me with my book, and making a start on the next? Have you thought of an ending?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh, that won’t do!’ said Bilbo. ‘Books ought to have good endings. How would this do: <em>and they all settled down and lived together happily ever after</em>?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It will do well, if it ever comes to that,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah!’ said Sam. ‘And where will they live? That’s what I often wonder.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the perils that lay ahead; but such was the&#13;
         virtue of the land of Rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds. The future, good or ill, was not&#13;
         forgotten, but ceased to have any power over the present. Health and hope grew strong in them, and they were content with&#13;
         each good day as it came, taking pleasure in every meal, and in every word and song.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>So the days slipped away, as each morning dawned bright and fair, and each evening followed cool and clear. But autumn was&#13;
         waning fast; slowly the golden light faded to pale &#13;
         <a id="page357"/>silver, and the lingering leaves fell from the naked trees. A wind began to blow chill from the Misty Mountains to the east.&#13;
         The Hunter’s Moon waxed round in the night sky, and put to flight all the lesser stars. But low in the South one star shone&#13;
         red. Every night, as the Moon waned again, it shone brighter and brighter. Frodo could see it from his window, deep in the&#13;
         heavens, burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of Elrond, and November had gone by with the last shreds of autumn, and&#13;
         December was passing, when the scouts began to return. Some had gone north beyond the springs of the Hoarwell into the Ettenmoors;&#13;
         and others had gone west, and with the help of Aragorn and the Rangers had searched the lands far down the Greyflood, as far&#13;
         as Tharbad, where the old North Road crossed the river by a ruined town. Many had gone east and south; and some of these had&#13;
         crossed the Mountains and entered Mirkwood, while others had climbed the pass at the sources of the Gladden River, and had&#13;
         come down into Wilderland and over the Gladden Fields and so at length had reached the old home of Radagast at Rhosgobel.&#13;
         Radagast was not there; and they had returned over the high pass that was called the Redhorn Gate. The sons of Elrond, Elladan&#13;
         and Elrohir, were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the Silverlode into a strange country, but&#13;
         of their errand they would not speak to any save to Elrond.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the Riders or other servants of the Enemy. Even from the&#13;
         Eagles of the Misty Mountains they had learned no fresh news. Nothing had been seen or heard of Gollum; but the wild wolves&#13;
         were still gathering, and were hunting again far up the Great River. Three of the black horses had been found at once drowned&#13;
         in the flooded Ford. On the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered the bodies of five more, and also a long black&#13;
         cloak, slashed and tattered. Of &#13;
         <a id="page358"/>the Black Riders no other trace was to be seen, and nowhere was their presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished&#13;
         from the North.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Eight out of the Nine are accounted for at least,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is rash to be too sure, yet I think that we may hope&#13;
         now that the Ringwraiths were scattered, and have been obliged to return as best they could to their Master in Mordor, empty&#13;
         and shapeless.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt again. Of course the Enemy has other servants, but they&#13;
         will have to journey all the way to the borders of Rivendell before they can pick up our trail. And if we are careful that&#13;
         will be hard to find. But we must delay no longer.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Elrond summoned the hobbits to him. He looked gravely at Frodo. ‘The time has come,’ he said. ‘If the Ring is to set out,&#13;
         it must go soon. But those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or force. They must pass into&#13;
         the domain of the Enemy far from aid. Do you still hold to your word, Frodo, that you will be the Ring-bearer?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do,’ said Frodo. ‘I will go with Sam.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,’ said Elrond. ‘I can foresee very little of your road; and how your task&#13;
         is to be achieved I do not know. The Shadow has crept now to the feet of the Mountains, and draws nigh even to the borders&#13;
         of the Greyflood; and under the Shadow all is dark to me. You will meet many foes, some open, and some disguised; and you&#13;
         may find friends upon your way when you least look for it. I will send out messages, such as I can contrive, to those whom&#13;
         I know in the wide world; but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well miscarry, or come no quicker than you&#13;
         yourself.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And I will choose you companions to go with you, as far as they will or fortune allows. The number must be few, since your&#13;
         hope is in speed and secrecy. Had I a host of Elves in armour of the Elder Days, it would avail little, save to arouse the&#13;
         power of Mordor.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page359"/>&#13;
      <p>‘The Company of the Ring shall be Nine; and the Nine Walkers shall be set against the Nine Riders that are evil. With you&#13;
         and your faithful servant, Gandalf will go; for this shall be his great task, and maybe the end of his labours.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘For the rest, they shall represent the other Free Peoples of the World: Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Legolas shall be for the&#13;
         Elves; and Gimli son of Glóin for the Dwarves. They are willing to go at least to the passes of the Mountains, and maybe beyond.&#13;
         For men you shall have Aragorn son of Arathorn, for the Ring of Isildur concerns him closely.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Strider!’ cried Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ he said with a smile. ‘I ask leave once again to be your companion, Frodo.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I would have begged you to come,’ said Frodo, ‘only I thought you were going to Minas Tirith with Boromir.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am,’ said Aragorn. ‘And the Sword-that-was-Broken shall be re-forged ere I set out to war. But your road and our road lie&#13;
         together for many hundreds of miles. Therefore Boromir will also be in the Company. He is a valiant man.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There remain two more to be found,’ said Elrond. ‘These I will consider. Of my household I may find some that it seems good&#13;
         to me to send.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But that will leave no place for us!’ cried Pippin in dismay. ‘We don’t want to be left behind. We want to go with Frodo.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies ahead,’ said Elrond.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Neither does Frodo,’ said Gandalf, unexpectedly supporting Pippin. ‘Nor do any of us see clearly. It is true that if these&#13;
         hobbits understood the danger, they would not dare to go. But they would still wish to go, or wish that they dared, and be&#13;
         shamed and unhappy. I think, Elrond, that in this matter it would be well to trust rather to their friendship than to great&#13;
         wisdom. Even if you chose for us an Elf-lord, such as Glorfindel, he could not storm the Dark Tower, nor open the road to&#13;
         the Fire by the power that is in him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You speak gravely,’ said Elrond, ‘but I am in doubt. The</p>&#13;
      <a id="page360"/>&#13;
      <p>Shire, I forebode, is not free now from peril; and these two I had thought to send back there as messengers, to do what they&#13;
         could, according to the fashion of their country, to warn the people of their danger. In any case, I judge that the younger&#13;
         of these two, Peregrin Took, should remain. My heart is against his going.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then, Master Elrond, you will have to lock me in prison, or send me home tied in a sack,’ said Pippin. ‘For otherwise I shall&#13;
         follow the Company.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Let it be so then. You shall go,’ said Elrond, and he sighed. ‘Now the tale of Nine is filled. In seven days the Company&#13;
         must depart.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Sword of Elendil was forged anew by Elvish smiths, and on its blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the&#13;
         crescent Moon and the rayed Sun, and about them was written many runes; for Aragorn son of Arathorn was going to war upon&#13;
         the marches of Mordor. Very bright was that sword when it was made whole again; the light of the sun shone redly in it, and&#13;
         the light of the moon shone cold, and its edge was hard and keen. And Aragorn gave it a new name and called it Andúril, Flame&#13;
         of the West.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Aragorn and Gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their road and the perils they would meet; and they pondered the storied&#13;
         and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of Elrond. Sometimes Frodo was with them; but he was content to&#13;
         lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with Bilbo.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In those last days the hobbits sat together in the evening in the Hall of Fire, and there among many tales they heard told&#13;
         in full the lay of Beren and Lúthien and the winning of the Great Jewel; but in the day, while Merry and Pippin were out and&#13;
         about, Frodo and Sam were to be found with Bilbo in his own small room. Then Bilbo would read passages from his book (which&#13;
         still seemed very incomplete), or scraps of his verses, or would take notes of Frodo’s adventures.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>On the morning of the last day Frodo was alone with Bilbo, &#13;
         <a id="page361"/>and the old hobbit pulled out from under his bed a wooden&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>box. He lifted the lid and fumbled inside.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here is your sword,’ he said. ‘But it was broken, you know. I took it to keep it safe but I’ve forgotten to ask if the smiths&#13;
         could mend it. No time now. So I thought, perhaps, you would care to have this, don’t you know?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard. Then he drew it, and its polished and well-tended blade&#13;
         glittered suddenly, cold and bright. ‘This is Sting,’ he said, and thrust it with little effort deep into a wooden beam. ‘Take&#13;
         it, if you like. I shan’t want it again, I expect.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo accepted it gratefully.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Also there is this!’ said Bilbo, bringing out a parcel which seemed to be rather heavy for its size. He unwound several folds&#13;
         of old cloth, and held up a small shirt of mail. It was close-woven of many rings, as supple almost as linen, cold as ice,&#13;
         and harder than steel. It shone like moonlit silver, and was studded with white gems. With it was a belt of pearl and crystal.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It’s a pretty thing, isn’t it?’ said Bilbo, moving it in the light. ‘And useful. It is my dwarf-mail that Thorin gave me.&#13;
         I got it back from Michel Delving before I started, and packed it with my luggage. I brought all the mementoes of my Journey&#13;
         away with me, except the Ring. But I did not expect to use this, and I don’t need it now, except to look at sometimes. You&#13;
         hardly feel any weight when you put it on.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I should look – well, I don’t think I should look right in it,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Just what I said myself,’ said Bilbo. ‘But never mind about looks. You can wear it under your outer clothes. Come on! You&#13;
         must share this secret with me. Don’t tell anybody else! But I should feel happier if I knew you were wearing it. I have a&#13;
         fancy it would turn even the knives of the Black Riders,’ he ended in a low voice.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very well, I will take it,’ said Frodo. Bilbo put it on him, and fastened Sting upon the glittering belt; and then Frodo&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page362"/>put over the top his old weather-stained breeches, tunic, and jacket.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Just a plain hobbit you look,’ said Bilbo. ‘But there is more about you now than appears on the surface. Good luck to you!’&#13;
         He turned away and looked out of the window, trying to hum a tune.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I cannot thank you as I should, Bilbo, for this, and for all your past kindnesses,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Don’t try!’ said the old hobbit, turning round and slapping him on the back. ‘Ow!’ he cried. ‘You are too hard now to slap!&#13;
         But there you are: Hobbits must stick together, and especially Bagginses. All I ask in return is: take as much care of yourself&#13;
         as you can, and bring back all the news you can, and any old songs and tales you can come by. I’ll do my best to finish my&#13;
         book before you return. I should like to write the second book, if I am spared.’ He broke off and turned to the window again,&#13;
         singing softly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>I sit beside the fire and think</em></p>&#13;

      <p>It was a cold grey day near the end of December. The East Wind was streaming through the bare branches of the trees, and seething&#13;
         in the dark pines on the hills. Ragged clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low. As the cheerless shadows of the early&#13;
         evening began to fall the Company made ready to set out. They were to start at dusk, for Elrond counselled them to journey&#13;
         under cover of night as often as they could, until they were far from Rivendell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You should fear the many eyes of the servants of Sauron,’ he said. ‘I do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the Riders&#13;
         has already reached him, and he will be filled with wrath. Soon now his spies on foot and wing will be abroad in the northern&#13;
         lands. Even of the sky above you must beware as you go on your way.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Company took little gear of war, for their hope was in secrecy not in battle. Aragorn had Andúril but no other weapon,&#13;
         and he went forth clad only in rusty green and brown, as a Ranger of the wilderness. Boromir had a long sword, in fashion&#13;
         like Andúril but of less lineage, and he bore also a shield and his war-horn.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills,’ he said, ‘and then let all the foes of Gondor flee!’ Putting it to&#13;
         his lips he blew a blast, and the echoes leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard that voice in Rivendell sprang to their&#13;
         feet.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Slow should you be to wind that horn again, Boromir,’ &#13;
         <a id="page364"/>said Elrond, ‘until you stand once more on the borders of your land, and dire need is on you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Maybe,’ said Boromir. ‘But always I have let my horn cry at setting forth, and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows,&#13;
         I will not go forth as a thief in the night.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short shirt of steel-rings, for dwarves make light of burdens; and in his belt was a broad-bladed&#13;
         axe. Legolas had a bow and a quiver, and at his belt a long white knife. The younger hobbits wore the swords that they had&#13;
         taken from the barrow; but Frodo took only Sting; and his mail-coat, as Bilbo wished, remained hidden. Gandalf bore his staff,&#13;
         but girt at his side was the elven-sword Glamdring, the mate of Orcrist that lay now upon the breast of Thorin under the Lonely&#13;
         Mountain.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>All were well furnished by Elrond with thick warm clothes, and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur. Spare food and&#13;
         clothes and blankets and other needs were laden on a pony, none other than the poor beast that they had brought from Bree.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The stay in Rivendell had worked a great wonder of change on him: he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth. It&#13;
         was Sam who had insisted on choosing him, declaring that Bill (as he called him) would pine, if he did not come.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That animal can nearly talk,’ he said, ‘and would talk, if he stayed here much longer. He gave me a look as plain as Mr.&#13;
         Pippin could speak it: if you don’t let me go with you, Sam, I’ll follow on my own.’ So Bill was going as the beast of burden,&#13;
         yet he was the only member of the Company that did not seem depressed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they were only waiting now for Gandalf, who had not yet come&#13;
         out of the house. A gleam of firelight came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in many windows. Bilbo huddled&#13;
         in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside Frodo. Aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees; only Elrond knew fully&#13;
         what this hour meant to him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page365"/>&#13;
      <p>The others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness.</p>&#13;
      <p>Sam was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and staring moodily into the gloom where the river roared stonily below;&#13;
         his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Bill, my lad,’ he said, ‘you oughtn’t to have took up with us. You could have stayed here and et the best hay till the new&#13;
         grass comes.’ Bill swished his tail and said nothing.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his mind all the things that he had stowed in it, wondering&#13;
         if he had forgotten anything: his chief treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt that he always carried and&#13;
         refilled when he could; a good supply of pipe-weed (but not near enough, I’ll warrant); flint and tinder; woollen hose; linen;&#13;
         various small belongings of his master’s that Frodo had forgotten and Sam had stowed to bring them out in triumph when they&#13;
         were called for. He went through them all.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Rope!’ he muttered. ‘No rope! And only last night you said to yourself: “Sam, what about a bit of rope? You’ll want it, if&#13;
         you haven’t got it.” Well, I’ll want it. I can’t get it now.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At that moment Elrond came out with Gandalf, and he called the Company to him. ‘This is my last word,’ he said in a low voice.&#13;
         ‘The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom. On him alone is any charge laid: neither to cast away the Ring,&#13;
         nor to deliver it to any servant of the Enemy nor indeed to let any handle it, save members of the Company and the Council,&#13;
         and only then in gravest need. The others go with him as free companions, to help him on his way. You may tarry, or come back,&#13;
         or turn aside into other paths, as chance allows. The further you go, the less easy will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or&#13;
         bond is laid on you to go further than you will. For you do not yet know the strength of your hearts, and you cannot foresee&#13;
         what each may meet upon the road.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,’ said Gimli.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page366"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Maybe,’ said Elrond, ‘but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has not seen the nightfall.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,’ said Gimli.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Or break it,’ said Elrond. ‘Look not too far ahead! But go now with good hearts! Farewell, and may the blessing of Elves&#13;
         and Men and all Free Folk go with you. May the stars shine upon your faces!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good ... good luck!’ cried Bilbo, stuttering with the cold. ‘I don’t suppose you will be able to keep a diary, Frodo my lad,&#13;
         but I shall expect a full account when you get back. And don’t be too long! Farewell!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Many others of Elrond’s household stood in the shadows and watched them go, bidding them farewell with soft voices. There&#13;
         was no laughter, and no song or music. At last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of Rivendell; and they came&#13;
         at length to the high moor where the wind hissed through the heather. Then with one glance at the Last Homely House twinkling&#13;
         below them they strode away far into the night.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At the Ford of Bruinen they left the Road and turning southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands. Their purpose&#13;
         was to hold this course west of the Mountains for many miles and days. The country was much rougher and more barren than in&#13;
         the green vale of the Great River in Wilderland on the other side of the range, and their going would be slow; but they hoped&#13;
         in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes. The spies of Sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country,&#13;
         and the paths were little known except to the people of Rivendell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf walked in front, and with him went Aragorn, who knew this land even in the dark. The others were in file behind, and&#13;
         Legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page367"/>&#13;
      <p>The first part of their journey was hard and dreary, and Frodo remembered little of it, save the wind. For many sunless days&#13;
         an icy blast came from the Mountains in the east, and no garment seemed able to keep out its searching fingers. Though the&#13;
         Company was well clad, they seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest. They slept uneasily during the middle of the day,&#13;
         in some hollow of the land, or hidden under the tangled thorn-bushes that grew in thickets in many places. In the late afternoon&#13;
         they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom risk the lighting&#13;
         of a fire. In the evening they went on again, always as nearly southward as they could find a way.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At first it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and stumbled until they were weary, they were creeping forward&#13;
         like snails, and getting nowhere. Each day the land looked much the same as it had the day before. Yet steadily the mountains&#13;
         were drawing nearer. South of Rivendell they rose ever higher, and bent westwards; and about the feet of the main range there&#13;
         was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few and winding,&#13;
         and led them often only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous swamps.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed. The wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south.&#13;
         The swift-flowing clouds lifted and melted away, and the sun came out, pale and bright. There came a cold clear dawn at the&#13;
         end of a long stumbling night-march. The travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly-trees whose grey-green&#13;
         trunks seemed to have been built out of the very stone of the hills. Their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red&#13;
         in the light of the rising sun.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Away in the south Frodo could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the path that the Company&#13;
         was taking. At the left of this high range rose three peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with &#13;
         <a id="page368"/>snow; its great, bare, northern precipice was still largely in the shadow, but where the sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed&#13;
         red.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf stood at Frodo’s side and looked out under his hand. ‘We have done well,’ he said. ‘We have reached the borders of&#13;
         the country that Men call Hollin; many Elves lived here in happier days, when Eregion was its name. Five-and-forty leagues&#13;
         as the crow flies we have come, though many long miles further our feet have walked. The land and the weather will be milder&#13;
         now, but perhaps all the more dangerous.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Dangerous or not, a real sunrise is mighty welcome,’ said Frodo, throwing back his hood and letting the morning light fall&#13;
         on his face.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But the mountains are ahead of us,’ said Pippin. ‘We must have turned eastwards in the night.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No,’ said Gandalf. ‘But you see further ahead in the clear light. Beyond those peaks the range bends round south-west. There&#13;
         are many maps in Elrond’s house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes I did, sometimes,’ said Pippin, ‘but I don’t remember them. Frodo has a better head for that sort of thing.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I need no map,’ said Gimli, who had come up with Legolas, and was gazing out before him with a strange light in his deep&#13;
         eyes. ‘There is the land where our fathers worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those mountains into many works&#13;
         of metal and of stone, and into many songs and tales. They stand tall in our dreams: Baraz, Zirak, Shathûr.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know them and their names, for under them lies Khazad-dûm,&#13;
         the Dwarrowdelf, that is now called the Black Pit, Moria in the Elvish tongue. Yonder stands Barazinbar, the Redhorn, cruel&#13;
         Caradhras; and beyond him are Silvertine and Cloudyhead: Celebdil the White, and Fanuidhol the Grey, that we call Zirakzigil&#13;
         and Bundushathûr.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There the Misty Mountains divide, and between their &#13;
         <a id="page369"/>arms lies the deep-shadowed valley which we cannot forget: Azanulbizar, the Dimrill Dale, which the Elves call Nanduhirion.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is for the Dimrill Dale that we are making,’ said Gandalf. ‘If we climb the pass that is called the Redhorn Gate, under&#13;
         the far side of Caradhras, we shall come down by the Dimrill Stair into the deep vale of the Dwarves. There lies the Mirrormere,&#13;
         and there the River Silverlode rises in its icy springs.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Dark is the water of Kheled-zâram,’ said Gimli, ‘and cold are the springs of Kibil-nâla. My heart trembles at the thought&#13;
         that I may see them soon.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘May you have joy of the sight, my good dwarf!’ said Gandalf. ‘But whatever you may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley.&#13;
         We must go down the Silverlode into the secret woods, and so to the Great River, and then——’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He paused.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, and where then?’ asked Merry. ‘To the end of the journey – in the end,’ said Gandalf. ‘We cannot look too far ahead.&#13;
         Let us be glad that the first stage is safely over. I think we will rest here, not only today but tonight as well. There is&#13;
         a wholesome air about Hollin. Much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets the Elves, if once they dwelt there.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is true,’ said Legolas. ‘But the Elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silvan folk, and the trees and&#13;
         the grass do not now remember them. Only I hear the stones lament them: <em>deep they delved us, fair they wrought us, high they builded us; but they are gone</em>. They are gone. They sought the Havens long ago.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">That morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly, and their supper-breakfast was merrier than&#13;
         it had been since they set out. They did not hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have all the night to sleep in,&#13;
         and they did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day. Only Aragorn was silent and restless.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page370"/>&#13;
      <p>After a while he left the Company and wandered on to the ridge; there he stood in the shadow of a tree, looking out southwards&#13;
         and westwards, with his head posed as if he was listening. Then he returned to the brink of the dell and looked down at the&#13;
         others laughing and talking.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What is the matter, Strider?’ Merry called up. ‘What are you looking for? Do you miss the East Wind?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No indeed,’ he answered. ‘But I miss something. I have been in the country of Hollin in many seasons. No folk dwell here&#13;
         now, but many other creatures live here at all times, especially birds. Yet now all things but you are silent. I can feel&#13;
         it. There is no sound for miles about us, and your voices seem to make the ground echo. I do not understand it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf looked up with sudden interest. ‘But what do you guess is the reason?’ he asked. ‘Is there more in it than surprise&#13;
         at seeing four hobbits, not to mention the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen or heard?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I hope that is it,’ answered Aragorn. ‘But I have a sense of watchfulness, and of fear, that I have never had here before.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then we must be more careful,’ said Gandalf. ‘If you bring a Ranger with you, it is well to pay attention to him, especially&#13;
         if the Ranger is Aragorn. We must stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">It was Sam’s turn that day to take the first watch, but Aragorn joined him. The others fell asleep. Then the silence grew&#13;
         until even Sam felt it. The breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard. The swish of the pony’s tail and the occasional&#13;
         movements of his feet became loud noises. Sam could hear his own joints creaking, if he stirred. Dead silence was around him,&#13;
         and over all hung a clear blue sky, as the Sun rode up from the East. Away in the South a dark patch appeared, and grew, and&#13;
         drove north like flying smoke in the wind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What’s that, Strider? It don’t look like a cloud,’ said Sam in a whisper to Aragorn. He made no answer, he was gazing intently&#13;
         at the sky; but before long Sam could see for himself &#13;
         <a id="page371"/>what was approaching. Flocks of birds, flying at great speed, were wheeling and circling, and traversing all the land as if&#13;
         they were searching for something; and they were steadily drawing nearer.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Lie flat and still!’ hissed Aragorn, pulling Sam down into the shade of a holly-bush; for a whole regiment of birds had broken&#13;
         away suddenly from the main host, and came, flying low, straight towards the ridge. Sam thought they were a kind of crow of&#13;
         large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense a throng that their shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, one&#13;
         harsh croak was heard.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Not until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the sky was again clear would Aragorn rise. Then he sprang&#13;
         up and went and wakened Gandalf.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the Mountains and the Greyflood,’ he said, ‘and they have passed&#13;
         over Hollin. They are not natives here; they are <em>crebain</em> out of Fangorn and Dunland. I do not know what they are about: possibly there is some trouble away south from which they&#13;
         are fleeing; but I think they are spying out the land. I have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky. I think&#13;
         we ought to move again this evening. Hollin is no longer wholesome for us: it is being watched.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And in that case so is the Redhorn Gate,’ said Gandalf; ‘and how we can get over that without being seen, I cannot imagine.&#13;
         But we will think of that when we must. As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that you are right.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before the <em>crebain</em> came,’ said Aragorn. ‘It must be put out and not lit again.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘Well if that isn’t a plague and a nuisance!’ said Pippin. The news: no fire, and a move again by night, had been broken to&#13;
         him, as soon as he woke in the late afternoon. ‘All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward to a real good meal tonight:&#13;
         something hot.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, you can go on looking forward,’ said Gandalf.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page372"/>&#13;
      <p>‘There may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort, and warmer feet.&#13;
         However, we are certain of one thing at any rate: it will get warmer as we get south.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Too warm, I shouldn’t wonder,’ muttered Sam to Frodo. ‘But I’m beginning to think it’s time we got a sight of that Fiery&#13;
         Mountain, and saw the end of the Road, so to speak. I thought at first that this here Redhorn, or whatever its name is, might&#13;
         be it, till Gimli spoke his piece. A fair jaw-cracker dwarf-language must be!’ Maps conveyed nothing to Sam’s mind, and all&#13;
         distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite out of his reckoning.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>All that day the Company remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over now and again; but as the westering Sun grew red they&#13;
         disappeared southwards. At dusk the Company set out, and turning now half east they steered their course towards Caradhras,&#13;
         which far away still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished Sun. One by one white stars sprang forth as the&#13;
         sky faded.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Guided by Aragorn they struck a good path. It looked to Frodo like the remains of an ancient road, that had once been broad&#13;
         and well planned, from Hollin to the mountain-pass. The Moon, now at the full, rose over the mountains, and cast a pale light&#13;
         in which the shadows of stones were black. Many of them looked to have been worked by hands, though now they lay tumbled and&#13;
         ruinous in a bleak, barren land.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was the cold chill hour before the first stir of dawn, and the moon was low. Frodo looked up at the sky. Suddenly he saw&#13;
         or felt a shadow pass over the high stars, as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again. He shivered.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Did you see anything pass over?’ he whispered to Gandalf, who was just ahead.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, but I felt it, whatever it was,’ he answered. ‘It may be nothing, only a wisp of thin cloud.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was moving fast then,’ muttered Aragorn, ‘and not with the wind.’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page373"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Nothing further happened that night. The next morning dawned even brighter than before. But the air was chill again; already&#13;
         the wind was turning back towards the east. For two more nights they marched on, climbing steadily but ever more slowly as&#13;
         their road wound up into the hills, and the mountains towered up, nearer and nearer. On the third morning Caradhras rose before&#13;
         them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There was a black look in the sky, and the sun was wan. The wind had gone now round to the north-east. Gandalf snuffed the&#13;
         air and looked back.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Winter deepens behind us,’ he said quietly to Aragorn. ‘The heights away north are whiter than they were; snow is lying far&#13;
         down their shoulders. Tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the Redhorn Gate. We may well be seen by watchers on&#13;
         that narrow path, and waylaid by some evil; but the weather may prove a more deadly enemy than any. What do you think of your&#13;
         course now, Aragorn?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo overheard these words, and understood that Gandalf and Aragorn were continuing some debate that had begun long before.&#13;
         He listened anxiously.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well, Gandalf,’ answered Aragorn. ‘And perils known and&#13;
         unknown will grow as we go on. But we must go on; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the mountains. Further south&#13;
         there are no passes, till one comes to the Gap of Rohan. I do not trust that way since your news of Saruman. Who knows which&#13;
         side now the marshals of the Horse-lords serve?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who knows indeed!’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is another way, and not by the pass of Caradhras: the dark and secret way that&#13;
         we have spoken of.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say nothing to the others, I beg, not until it is plain that there is no other&#13;
         way.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We must decide before we go further,’ answered Gandalf.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page374"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the others rest and sleep,’ said Aragorn.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">In the late afternoon, while the others were finishing their breakfast, Gandalf and Aragorn went aside together and stood&#13;
         looking at Caradhras. Its sides were now dark and sullen, and its head was in grey cloud. Frodo watched them, wondering which&#13;
         way the debate would go. When they returned to the Company Gandalf spoke, and then he knew that it had been decided to face&#13;
         the weather and the high pass. He was relieved. He could not guess what was the other dark and secret way, but the very mention&#13;
         of it had seemed to fill Aragorn with dismay, and Frodo was glad that it had been abandoned.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘From signs that we have seen lately,’ said Gandalf, ‘I fear that the Redhorn Gate may be watched; and also I have doubts&#13;
         of the weather that is coming up behind. Snow may come. We must go with all the speed that we can. Even so it will take us&#13;
         more than two marches before we reach the top of the pass. Dark will come early this evening. We must leave as soon as you&#13;
         can get ready.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will add a word of advice, if I may,’ said Boromir. ‘I was born under the shadow of the White Mountains and know something&#13;
         of journeys in the high places. We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down on the other side. It will not&#13;
         help us to keep so secret that we are frozen to death. When we leave here, where there are still a few trees and bushes, each&#13;
         of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And Bill could take a bit more, couldn’t you, lad?’ said Sam. The pony looked at him mournfully.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Very well,’ said Gandalf. ‘But we must not use the wood – not unless it is a choice between fire and death.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Company set out again, with good speed at first; but soon their way became steep and difficult. The twisting and climbing&#13;
         road had in many places almost disappeared, &#13;
         <a id="page375"/>and was blocked with many fallen stones. The night grew deadly dark under great clouds. A bitter wind swirled among the rocks.&#13;
         By midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountains. The narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs to&#13;
         the left, above which the grim flanks of Caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom; on the right was a gulf of darkness&#13;
         where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top. Frodo felt a soft touch on his face. He put out&#13;
         his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling on his sleeve.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They went on. But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all the air, and swirling into Frodo’s eyes. The dark bent&#13;
         shapes of Gandalf and Aragorn only a pace or two ahead could hardly be seen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t like this at all,’ panted Sam just behind. ‘Snow’s all right on a fine morning, but I like to be in bed while it’s&#13;
         falling. I wish this lot would go off to Hobbiton! Folk might welcome it there.’ Except on the high moors of the Northfarthing&#13;
         a heavy fall was rare in the Shire, and was regarded as a pleasant event and a chance for fun. No living hobbit (save Bilbo)&#13;
         could remember the Fell Winter of 1311, when white wolves invaded the Shire over the frozen Brandywine.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf halted. Snow was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was already ankle-deep about his boots.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘This is what I feared,’ he said. ‘What do you say now, Aragorn?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That I feared it too,’ Aragorn answered, ‘but less than other things. I knew the risk of snow, though it seldom falls heavily&#13;
         so far south, save high up in the mountains. But we are not high yet; we are still far down, where the paths are usually open&#13;
         all the winter.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wonder if this is a contrivance of the Enemy,’ said Boromir. ‘They say in my land that he can govern the storms in the&#13;
         Mountains of Shadow that stand upon the borders of Mordor. He has strange powers and many allies.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page376"/>&#13;
      <p>‘His arm has grown long indeed,’ said Gimli, ‘if he can draw snow down from the North to trouble us here three hundred leagues&#13;
         away.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘His arm has grown long,’ said Gandalf.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">While they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow slackened until it almost ceased. They tramped on again. But they&#13;
         had not gone more than a furlong when the storm returned with fresh fury. The wind whistled and the snow became a blinding&#13;
         blizzard. Soon even Boromir found it hard to keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly double, toiled along behind the taller folk,&#13;
         but it was plain that they could not go much further, if the snow continued. Frodo’s feet felt like lead. Pippin was dragging&#13;
         behind. Even Gimli, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he trudged.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Company halted suddenly, as if they had come to an agreement without any words being spoken. They heard eerie noises in&#13;
         the darkness round them. It may have been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds&#13;
         were those of shrill cries, and wild howls of laughter. Stones began to fall from the mountain-side, whistling over their&#13;
         heads, or crashing on the path beside them. Every now and again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from&#13;
         hidden heights above.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We cannot go further tonight,’ said Boromir. ‘Let those call it the wind who will; there are fell voices on the air; and&#13;
         these stones are aimed at us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do call it the wind,’ said Aragorn. ‘But that does not make what you say untrue. There are many evil and unfriendly things&#13;
         in the world that have little love for those that go on two legs, and yet are not in league with Sauron, but have purposes&#13;
         of their own. Some have been in this world longer than he.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Caradhras was called the Cruel, and had an ill name,’ said Gimli, ‘long years ago, when rumour of Sauron had not been heard&#13;
         in these lands.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page377"/>&#13;
      <p>‘It matters little who is the enemy, if we cannot beat off his attack,’ said Gandalf.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘But what can we do?’ cried Pippin miserably. He was leaning on Merry and Frodo, and he was shivering.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Either stop where we are, or go back,’ said Gandalf. ‘It is no good going on. Only a little higher, if I remember rightly,&#13;
         this path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough at the bottom of a long hard slope. We should have no shelter&#13;
         there from snow, or stones – or anything else.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And it is no good going back while the storm holds,’ said Aragorn. ‘We have passed no place on the way up that offered more&#13;
         shelter than this cliff-wall we are under now.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Shelter!’ muttered Sam. ‘If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof make a house.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could. It faced southwards, and near the bottom it leaned&#13;
         out a little, so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stones. But&#13;
         eddying blasts swirled round them from every side, and the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They huddled together with their backs to the wall. Bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of the hobbits,&#13;
         and screened them a little; but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks, and it went on mounting. If they had had&#13;
         no larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely buried.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>A great sleepiness came over Frodo; he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream. He thought a fire was heating&#13;
         his toes, and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard Bilbo’s voice speaking. <em>I don’t think much of your diary</em>, he said. <em>Snowstorms on January the twelfth: there was no need to come back to report that!</em></p>&#13;
      <p><em>But I wanted rest and sleep, Bilbo</em>, Frodo answered with an effort, when he felt himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness. Boromir had lifted&#13;
         him off the ground out of a nest of snow.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page378"/>&#13;
      <p>‘This will be the death of the halflings, Gandalf,’ said Boromir. ‘It is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our&#13;
         heads. We must do something to save ourselves.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Give them this,’ said Gandalf, searching in his pack and drawing out a leathern flask. ‘Just a mouthful each – for all of&#13;
         us. It is very precious. It is <em>miruvor</em>, the cordial of Imladris. Elrond gave it to me at our parting. Pass it round!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As soon as Frodo had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness&#13;
         left his limbs. The others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour. But the snow did not relent. It whirled about them&#13;
         thicker than ever, and the wind blew louder.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you say to fire?’ asked Boromir suddenly. ‘The choice seems near now between fire and death, Gandalf. Doubtless we&#13;
         shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will not help us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You may make a fire, if you can,’ answered Gandalf. ‘If there are any watchers that can endure this storm, then they can&#13;
         see us, fire or no.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of Boromir, it passed the skill of Elf or even Dwarf to strike&#13;
         a flame that would hold amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel. At last reluctantly Gandalf himself took a hand.&#13;
         Picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and then with a word of command, <em>naur an edraith ammen!</em> he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it. At once a great spout of green and blue flame sprang out, and the wood&#13;
         flared and sputtered.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them,’ he said. ‘I have written <em>Gandalf is here</em> in signs that all can read from Rivendell to the mouths of Anduin.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But the Company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes. Their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire.&#13;
         The wood burned merrily; and though all round it the snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under their feet, they warmed their&#13;
         hands gladly at the blaze. There they &#13;
         <a id="page379"/>stood, stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames. A red light was on their tired and anxious faces;&#13;
         behind them the night was like a black wall.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The fire burned low, and the last faggot was thrown on.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘The night is getting old,’ said Aragorn. ‘The dawn is not far off.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘If any dawn can pierce these clouds,’ said Gimli. Boromir stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness. ‘The&#13;
         snow is growing less,’ he said, ‘and the wind is quieter.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white for a moment in the light of the dying&#13;
         fire; but for a long time he could see no sign of their slackening. Then suddenly, as sleep was beginning to creep over him&#13;
         again, he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen, and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer. Very slowly a dim light&#13;
         began to grow. At last the snow stopped altogether.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world. Below their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless&#13;
         deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was altogether lost; but the heights above were hidden in great clouds&#13;
         still heavy with the threat of snow.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gimli looked up and shook his head. ‘Caradhras has not forgiven us,’ he said. ‘He has more snow yet to fling at us, if we&#13;
         go on. The sooner we go back and down the better.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>To this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It might well prove impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of&#13;
         their fire the snow lay many feet deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it had been scooped and piled by the&#13;
         wind into great drifts against the cliff.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If Gandalf would go before us with a bright flame, he might melt a path for you,’ said Legolas. The storm had troubled him&#13;
         little, and he alone of the Company remained still light of heart.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun &#13;
         <a id="page380"/>to save us,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But I must have something to work on. I cannot burn snow.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well,’ said Boromir, ‘when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as we say in my country. The strongest of us must seek&#13;
         a way. See! Though all is now snow-clad, our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder. It was there&#13;
         that the snow first began to burden us. If we could reach that point, maybe it would prove easier beyond. It is no more than&#13;
         a furlong off, I guess.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then let us force a path thither, you and I!’ said Aragorn.</p>&#13;
      <p>Aragorn was the tallest of the Company, but Boromir, little less in height, was broader and heavier in build. He led the way,&#13;
         and Aragorn followed him. Slowly they moved off, and were soon toiling heavily. In places the snow was breast-high, and often&#13;
         Boromir seemed to be swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than walking.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then he turned to the others. ‘The strongest must seek a&#13;
         way, say you? But I say: let a ploughman plough, but choose an otter for swimming, and for running light over grass and leaf,&#13;
         or over snow – an Elf.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then Frodo noticed as if for the first time, though he had long known it, that the Elf&#13;
         had no boots, but wore only light shoes, as he always did, and his feet made little imprint in the snow.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Farewell!’ he said to Gandalf. ‘I go to find the Sun!’ Then swift as a runner over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking&#13;
         the toiling men, with a wave of his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance, and vanished round the rocky turn.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The others waited huddled together, watching until Boromir and Aragorn dwindled into black specks in the whiteness. At length&#13;
         they too passed from sight. The time dragged on. The clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>An hour, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, &#13;
         <a id="page381"/>and then at last they saw Legolas coming back. At the same time Boromir and Aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him&#13;
         and came labouring up the slope.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well,’ cried Legolas as he ran up, ‘I have not brought the Sun. She is walking in the blue fields of the South, and a little&#13;
         wreath of snow on this Redhorn hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam of good hope for those who&#13;
         are doomed to go on feet. There is the greatest wind-drift of all just beyond the turn, and there our Strong Men were almost&#13;
         buried. They despaired, until I returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall. And on the other side&#13;
         the snow suddenly grows less, while further down it is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit’s toes.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah, it is as I said,’ growled Gimli. ‘It was no ordinary storm. It is the ill will of Caradhras. He does not love Elves and&#13;
         Dwarves, and that drift was laid to cut off our escape.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But happily your Caradhras has forgotten that you have Men with you,’ said Boromir, who came up at that moment. ‘And doughty&#13;
         Men too, if I may say it; though lesser men with spades might have served you better. Still, we have thrust a lane through&#13;
         the drift; and for that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as Elves.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through the drift?’ said Pippin, voicing the thought of all the hobbits.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Have hope!’ said Boromir. ‘I am weary, but I still have some strength left, and Aragorn too. We will bear the little folk.&#13;
         The others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us. Come, Master Peregrin! I will begin with you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He lifted up the hobbit. ‘Cling to my back! I shall need my arms,’ he said and strode forward. Aragorn with Merry came behind.&#13;
         Pippin marvelled at his strength, seeing the passage that he had already forced with no other tool than his great limbs. Even&#13;
         now, burdened as he was, he was widening the track for those who followed, thrusting the snow aside as he went.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They came at length to the great drift. It was flung across &#13;
         <a id="page382"/>the mountain-path like a sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if shaped with knives, reared up more than twice the&#13;
         height of Boromir; but through the middle a passage had been beaten, rising and falling like a bridge. On the far side Merry&#13;
         and Pippin were set down, and there they waited with Legolas for the rest of the Company to arrive.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>After a while Boromir returned carrying Sam. Behind in the narrow but now well-trodden track came Gandalf, leading Bill with&#13;
         Gimli perched among the baggage. Last came Aragorn carrying Frodo. They passed through the lane; but hardly had Frodo touched&#13;
         the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow. The spray of it half blinded the&#13;
         Company as they crouched against the cliff, and when the air cleared again they saw that the path was blocked behind them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Enough, enough!’ cried Gimli. ‘We are departing as quickly as we may!’ And indeed with that last stroke the malice of the&#13;
         mountain seemed to be expended, as if Caradhras was satisfied that the invaders had been beaten off and would not dare to&#13;
         return. The threat of snow lifted; the clouds began to break and the light grew broader.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As Legolas had reported, they found that the snow became steadily more shallow as they went down, so that even the hobbits&#13;
         could trudge along. Soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the&#13;
         first flakes of snow the night before.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The morning was now far advanced. From the high place they looked back westwards over the lower lands. Far away in the tumble&#13;
         of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell from which they had started to climb the pass.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo’s legs ached. He was chilled to the bone and hungry; and his head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march&#13;
         downhill. Black specks swam before his eyes. He rubbed them, but the black specks remained. In the distance below him, but&#13;
         still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were circling in the air.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The birds again!’ said Aragorn, pointing down.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page383"/>&#13;
      <p>‘That cannot be helped now,’ said Gandalf. ‘Whether they are good or evil, or have nothing to do with us at all, we must go&#13;
         down at once. Not even on the knees of Caradhras will we wait for another night-fall!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>A cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the Redhorn Gate, and stumbled wearily down the slope.&#13;
         Caradhras had defeated them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

            <em>Chapter</em> 4</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-16">A JOURNEY IN THE DARK</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">It was evening, and the grey light was again waning fast, when they halted for the night. They were very weary. The mountains&#13;
         were veiled in deepening dusk, and the wind was cold. Gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the <em>miruvor</em> of Rivendell. When they had eaten some food he called a council.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We cannot, of course, go on again tonight,’ he said. ‘The attack on the Redhorn Gate has tired us out, and we must rest here&#13;
         for a while.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And then where are we to go?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We still have our journey and our errand before us,’ answered Gandalf. ‘We have no choice but to go on, or to return to Rivendell.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin’s face brightened visibly at the mere mention of return to Rivendell; Merry and Sam looked up hopefully. But Aragorn&#13;
         and Boromir made no sign. Frodo looked troubled.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wish I was back there,’ he said. ‘But how can I return without shame – unless there is indeed no other way, and we are&#13;
         already defeated?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You are right, Frodo,’ said Gandalf: ‘to go back is to admit defeat, and face worse defeat to come. If we go back now, then&#13;
         the Ring must remain there: we shall not be able to set out again. Then sooner or later Rivendell will be besieged, and after&#13;
         a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed. The Ringwraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the power&#13;
         and terror they would possess if the Ruling Ring was on their master’s hand again.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then we must go on, if there is a way,’ said Frodo with a sigh. Sam sank back into gloom.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is a way that we may attempt,’ said Gandalf. ‘I &#13;
         <a id="page385"/>thought from the beginning, when first I considered this journey, that we should try it. But it is not a pleasant way, and&#13;
         I have not spoken of it to the Company before. Aragorn was against it, until the pass over the mountains had at least been&#13;
         tried.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If it is a worse road than the Redhorn Gate, then it must be evil indeed,’ said Merry. ‘But you had better tell us about&#13;
         it, and let us know the worst at once.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The road that I speak of leads to the Mines of Moria,’ said Gandalf. Only Gimli lifted up his head; a smouldering fire was&#13;
         in his eyes. On all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name. Even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague fear.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The road may lead to Moria, but how can we hope that it will lead through Moria?’ said Aragorn darkly.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is a name of ill omen,’ said Boromir. ‘Nor do I see the need to go there. If we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey&#13;
         southwards, until we come to the Gap of Rohan, where men are friendly to my people, taking the road that I followed on my&#13;
         way hither. Or we might pass by and cross the Isen into Langstrand and Lebennin, and so come to Gondor from the regions nigh&#13;
         to the sea.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Things have changed since you came north, Boromir,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Did you not hear what I told you of Saruman? With&#13;
         him I may have business of my own ere all is over. But the Ring must not come near Isengard, if that can by any means be prevented.&#13;
         The Gap of Rohan is closed to us while we go with the Bearer.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘As for the longer road: we cannot afford the time. We might spend a year in such a journey, and we should pass through many&#13;
         lands that are empty and harbourless. Yet they would not be safe. The watchful eyes both of Saruman and of the Enemy are on&#13;
         them. When you came north, Boromir, you were in the Enemy’s eyes only one stray wanderer from the South and a matter of small&#13;
         concern to him: his mind was busy with the pursuit of the Ring. But you return now as a member of the Ring’s Company, and&#13;
         you are in peril as &#13;
         <a id="page386"/>long as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every league that we go south under the naked sky.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Since our open attempt on the mountain-pass our plight has become more desperate, I fear. I see now little hope, if we do&#13;
         not soon vanish from sight for a while, and cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go neither over the mountains,&#13;
         nor round them, but under them. That is a road at any rate that the Enemy will least expect us to take.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We do not know what he expects,’ said Boromir. ‘He may watch all roads, likely and unlikely. In that case to enter Moria&#13;
         would be to walk into a trap, hardly better than knocking at the gates of the Dark Tower itself. The name of Moria is black.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You speak of what you do not know, when you liken Moria to the stronghold of Sauron,’ answered Gandalf. ‘I alone of you have&#13;
         ever been in the dungeons of the Dark Lord, and only in his older and lesser dwelling in Dol Guldur. Those who pass the gates&#13;
         of Barad-dûr do not return. But I would not lead you into Moria if there were no hope of coming out again. If there are Orcs&#13;
         there, it may prove ill for us, that is true. But most of the Orcs of the Misty Mountains were scattered or destroyed in the&#13;
         Battle of Five Armies. The Eagles report that Orcs are gathering again from afar; but there is a hope that Moria is still&#13;
         free.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is even a chance that Dwarves are there, and that in some deep hall of his fathers, Balin son of Fundin may be found.&#13;
         However it may prove, one must tread the path that need chooses!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will tread the path with you, Gandalf!’ said Gimli. ‘I will go and look on the halls of Durin, whatever may wait there&#13;
         – if you can find the doors that are shut.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good, Gimli!’ said Gandalf. ‘You encourage me. We will seek the hidden doors together. And we will come through. In the ruins&#13;
         of the Dwarves, a dwarf ’s head will be less easy to bewilder than Elves or Men or Hobbits. Yet it will not be the first time&#13;
         that I have been to Moria. I sought there long &#13;
         <a id="page387"/>for Thráin son of Thrór after he was lost. I passed through, and I came out again alive!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I too once passed the Dimrill Gate,’ said Aragorn quietly; ‘but though I also came out again, the memory is very evil. I&#13;
         do not wish to enter Moria a second time.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And I don’t wish to enter it even once,’ said Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Nor me,’ muttered Sam.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of course not!’ said Gandalf. ‘Who would? But the question is: who will follow me, if I lead you there?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will,’ said Gimli eagerly.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will,’ said Aragorn heavily. ‘You followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow, and have said no word of blame. I will&#13;
         follow your lead now – if this last warning does not move you. It is not of the Ring, nor of us others that I am thinking&#13;
         now, but of you, Gandalf. And I say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will <em>not</em> go,’ said Boromir; ‘not unless the vote of the whole Company is against me. What do Legolas and the little folk say? The&#13;
         Ring-bearer’s voice surely should be heard?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not wish to go to Moria,’ said Legolas.</p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits said nothing. Sam looked at Frodo. At last Frodo spoke. ‘I do not wish to go,’ he said; ‘but neither do I wish&#13;
         to refuse the advice of Gandalf. I beg that there should be no vote, until we have slept on it. Gandalf will get votes easier&#13;
         in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom. How the wind howls!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At these words all fell into silent thought. They heard the wind hissing among the rocks and trees, and there was a howling&#13;
         and wailing round them in the empty spaces of the night.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet. ‘How the wind howls!’ he cried. ‘It is howling with wolf-voices. The Wargs have come west&#13;
         of the Mountains!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Need we wait until morning then?’ said Gandalf. ‘It is as I said. The hunt is up! Even if we live to see the dawn, who &#13;
         <a id="page388"/>now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves on his trail?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘How far is Moria?’ asked Boromir.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,’ answered&#13;
         Gandalf grimly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,’ said Boromir. ‘The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc&#13;
         that one fears.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘True!’ said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath. ‘But where the warg howls, there also the orc prowls.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wish I had taken Elrond’s advice,’ muttered Pippin to Sam. ‘I am no good after all. There is not enough of the breed of&#13;
         Bandobras the Bullroarer in me: these howls freeze my blood. I don’t ever remember feeling so wretched.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘My heart’s right down in my toes, Mr. Pippin,’ said Sam. ‘But we aren’t etten yet, and there are some stout folk here with&#13;
         us. Whatever may be in store for old Gandalf, I’ll wager it isn’t a wolf ’s belly.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">For their defence in the night the Company climbed to the top of the small hill under which they had been sheltering. It was&#13;
         crowned with a knot of old and twisted trees, about which lay a broken circle of boulder-stones. In the midst of this they&#13;
         lit a fire, for there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep their trail from discovery by the hunting packs.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Round the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily. Poor Bill the pony trembled and sweated where he&#13;
         stood. The howling of the wolves was now all round them, sometimes nearer and sometimes further off. In the dead of night&#13;
         many shining eyes were seen peering over the brow of the hill. Some advanced almost to the ring of stones. At a gap in the&#13;
         circle a great dark wolf-shape could be seen halted, gazing at them. A shuddering howl broke from him, as if he were a captain&#13;
         summoning his pack to the assault.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page389"/>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. ‘Listen, Hound of Sauron!’ he cried. ‘Gandalf is here. Fly,&#13;
         if you value your foul skin! I will shrivel you from tail to snout, if you come within this ring.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The wolf snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap. At that moment there was a sharp twang. Legolas had loosed his&#13;
         bow. There was a hideous yell, and the leaping shape thudded to the ground; the Elvish arrow had pierced its throat. The watching&#13;
         eyes were suddenly extinguished. Gandalf and Aragorn strode forward, but the hill was deserted; the hunting packs had fled.&#13;
         All about them the darkness grew silent, and no cry came on the sighing wind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The night was old, and westward the waning moon was setting, gleaming fitfully through the breaking clouds. Suddenly Frodo&#13;
         started from sleep. Without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the camp. A great host of Wargs had&#13;
         gathered silently and was now attacking them from every side at once.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Fling fuel on the fire!’ cried Gandalf to the hobbits. ‘Draw your blades, and stand back to back!’</p>&#13;
      <p>In the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, Frodo saw many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones. More and more&#13;
         followed. Through the throat of one huge leader Aragorn passed his sword with a thrust; with a great sweep Boromir hewed the&#13;
         head off another. Beside them Gimli stood with his stout legs apart, wielding his dwarf-axe. The bow of Legolas was singing.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In the wavering firelight Gandalf seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, a great menacing shape like the monument of some ancient&#13;
         king of stone set upon a hill. Stooping like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the wolves. They gave&#13;
         back before him. High in the air he tossed the blazing brand. It flared with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and his&#13;
         voice rolled like thunder.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>Naur an edraith ammen! Naur dan i ngaurhoth!</em>’ he cried.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him &#13;
         <a id="page390"/>burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top to tree-top. The whole hill was crowned with dazzling&#13;
         light. The swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered. The last arrow of Legolas kindled in the air as it flew,&#13;
         and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf-chieftain. All the others fled.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks; a bitter smoke curled above the burned tree-stumps,&#13;
         and blew darkly from the hill, as the first light of dawn came dimly in the sky. Their enemies were routed and did not return.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What did I tell you, Mr. Pippin?’ said Sam, sheathing his sword. ‘Wolves won’t get him. That was an eye-opener, and no mistake!&#13;
         Nearly singed the hair off my head!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">When the full light of the morning came no signs of the wolves were to be found, and they looked in vain for the bodies of&#13;
         the dead. No trace of the fight remained but the charred trees and the arrows of Legolas lying on the hill-top. All were undamaged&#13;
         save one of which only the point was left.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is as I feared,’ said Gandalf. ‘These were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness. Let us eat quickly and&#13;
         go!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>That day the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command of some power that had no longer any use for snow,&#13;
         since they had retreated from the pass, a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things that moved in the wild&#13;
         could be seen from far away. The wind had been turning through north to north-west during the night, and now it failed. The&#13;
         clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened, high and blue. As they stood upon the hillside, ready to depart, a pale&#13;
         sunlight gleamed over the mountain-tops.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We must reach the doors before sunset,’ said Gandalf, ‘or I fear we shall not reach them at all. It is not far, but our path&#13;
         may be winding, for here Aragorn cannot guide us; he has &#13;
         <a id="page391"/>seldom walked in this country, and only once have I been under the west wall of Moria, and that was long ago.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There it lies,’ he said, pointing away south-eastwards to where the mountains’ sides fell sheer into the shadows at their&#13;
         feet. In the distance could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs, and in their midst, taller than the rest, one great grey&#13;
         wall. ‘When we left the pass I led you southwards, and not back to our starting point, as some of you may have noticed. It&#13;
         is well that I did so, for now we have several miles less to cross, and haste is needed. Let us go!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not know which to hope,’ said Boromir grimly: ‘that Gandalf will find what he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we&#13;
         shall find the gates lost for ever. All choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and the wall the likeliest chance.&#13;
         Lead on!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Gimli now walked ahead by the wizard’s side, so eager was he to come to Moria. Together they led the Company back towards&#13;
         the mountains. The only road of old to Moria from the west had lain along the course of a stream, the Sirannon, that ran out&#13;
         from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors had stood. But either Gandalf was astray, or else the land had changed in&#13;
         recent years; for he did not strike the stream where he looked to find it, only a few miles southwards from their start.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The morning was passing towards noon, and still the Company wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones. Nowhere&#13;
         could they see any gleam of water or hear any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts sank. They saw no living thing,&#13;
         and not a bird was in the sky; but what the night would bring, if it caught them in that lost land, none of them cared to&#13;
         think.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly Gimli, who had pressed on ahead, called back to them. He was standing on a knoll and pointing to the right. Hurrying&#13;
         up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel. It was empty and silent, and hardly a trickle of water flowed among the&#13;
         brown and red-stained stones of its bed; &#13;
         <a id="page392"/>but on the near side there was a path, much broken and decayed, that wound its way among the ruined walls and paving-stones&#13;
         of an ancient highroad.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah! Here it is at last!’ said Gandalf. ‘This is where the stream ran: Sirannon, the Gate-stream, they used to call it. But&#13;
         what has happened to the water, I cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy. Come! We must hurry on. We are late.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Company were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles. The sun turned&#13;
         from the noon and began to go west. After a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again. Before them the mountains frowned,&#13;
         but their path lay in a deep trough of land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which had been veering southwards between the brink of the channel and&#13;
         a steep fall of the land to the left, turned and went due east again. Rounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff,&#13;
         some five fathoms high, with a broken and jagged top. Over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide cleft that seemed&#13;
         to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Indeed things have changed!’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is no mistaking the place. There is all that remains of the Stair Falls.&#13;
         If I remember right, there was a flight of steps cut in the rock at their side, but the main road wound away left and climbed&#13;
         with several loops up to the level ground at the top. There used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls right up to the Walls&#13;
         of Moria, and the Sirannon flowed through it with the road beside it. Let us go and see what things are like now!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They found the stone steps without difficulty, and Gimli sprang swiftly up them, followed by Gandalf and Frodo. When they&#13;
         reached the top they saw that they could go no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of the Gate-stream was revealed.&#13;
         Behind them the sinking Sun filled &#13;
         <a id="page393"/>the cool western sky with glimmering gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake. Neither sky nor sunset was reflected on&#13;
         its sullen surface. The Sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the valley. Beyond the ominous water were reared vast&#13;
         cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the fading light: final and impassable. No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or&#13;
         crack could Frodo see in the frowning stone.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There are the Walls of Moria,’ said Gandalf, pointing across the water. ‘And there the Gate stood once upon a time, the Elven&#13;
         Door at the end of the road from Hollin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. None of the Company, I guess, will&#13;
         wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of the day. It has an unwholesome look.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We must find a way round the northern edge,’ said Gimli. ‘The first thing for the Company to do is to climb up by the main&#13;
         path and see where that will lead us. Even if there were no lake, we could not get our baggage-pony up this stair.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the Mines,’ said Gandalf. ‘The road under the mountains is a dark road,&#13;
         and there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread, even if we can.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Poor old Bill!’ said Frodo. ‘I had not thought of that. And poor Sam! I wonder what he will say?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am sorry,’ said Gandalf. ‘Poor Bill has been a useful companion, and it goes to my heart to turn him adrift now. I would&#13;
         have travelled lighter and brought no animal, least of all this one that Sam is fond of, if I had had my way. I feared all&#13;
         along that we should be obliged to take this road.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The day was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset, when the Company, with all&#13;
         the speed they could, climbed up the slopes and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked to be no more than two&#13;
         or three furlongs at the widest point. How far it stretched away southward they could not see in the failing light; but its&#13;
         northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood, and between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley &#13;
         <a id="page394"/>and the water’s edge there was a rim of open ground. They hurried forward, for they had still a mile or two to go before they&#13;
         could reach the point on the far shore that Gandalf was making for; and then he had still to find the doors.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a narrow creek that barred their way. It was green and stagnant,&#13;
         thrust out like a slimy arm towards the enclosing hills. Gimli strode forward undeterred, and found that the water was shallow,&#13;
         no more than ankle-deep at the edge. Behind him they walked in file, threading their way with care, for under the weedy pools&#13;
         were sliding and greasy stones, and footing was treacherous. Frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark unclean&#13;
         water on his feet.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As Sam, the last of the Company, led Bill up on to the dry ground on the far side, there came a soft sound: a swish, followed&#13;
         by a plop, as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water. Turning quickly they saw ripples, black-edged with shadow&#13;
         in the waning light: great rings were widening outwards from a point far out in the lake. There was a bubbling noise, and&#13;
         then silence. The dusk deepened, and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as quickly as they could. They reached the strip of dry land&#13;
         between the lake and the cliffs: it was narrow, often hardly a dozen yards across, and encumbered with fallen rock and stones;&#13;
         but they found a way, hugging the cliff, and keeping as far from the dark water as they might. A mile southwards along the&#13;
         shore they came upon holly trees. Stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets,&#13;
         or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But close under the cliff there stood, still strong&#13;
         and living, two tall trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined. Their great roots spread&#13;
         from the wall to the water. Under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of the&#13;
         Stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing deep night-shadows &#13;
         <a id="page395"/>about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the end of the road.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, here we are at last!’ said Gandalf. ‘Here the Elvenway from Hollin ended. Holly was the token of the people of that&#13;
         land, and they planted it here to mark the end of their domain; for the West-door was made chiefly for their use in their&#13;
         traffic with the Lords of Moria. Those were happier days, when there was still close friendship at times between folk of different&#13;
         race, even between Dwarves and Elves.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship waned,’ said Gimli.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,’ said Legolas.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have heard both,’ said Gandalf; ‘and I will not give judgement now. But I beg you two, Legolas and Gimli, at least to be&#13;
         friends, and to help me. I need you both. The doors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find them the better. Night is&#13;
         at hand!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Turning to the others he said: ‘While I am searching, will you each make ready to enter the Mines? For here I fear we must&#13;
         say farewell to our good beast of burden. You must lay aside much of the stuff that we brought against bitter weather: you&#13;
         will not need it inside, nor, I hope, when we come through and journey on down into the South. Instead each of us must take&#13;
         a share of what the pony carried, especially the food and the water-skins.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But you can’t leave poor old Bill behind in this forsaken place, Mr. Gandalf!’ cried Sam, angry and distressed. ‘I won’t&#13;
         have it, and that’s flat. After he has come so far and all!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am sorry, Sam,’ said the wizard. ‘But when the Door opens I do not think you will be able to drag your Bill inside, into&#13;
         the long dark of Moria. You will have to choose between Bill and your master.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He’d follow Mr. Frodo into a dragon’s den, if I led him,’ protested Sam. ‘It’d be nothing short of murder to turn him loose&#13;
         with all these wolves about.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page396"/>&#13;
      <p>‘It will be short of murder, I hope,’ said Gandalf. He laid his hand on the pony’s head, and spoke in a low voice. ‘Go with&#13;
         words of guard and guiding on you,’ he said. ‘You are a wise beast, and have learned much in Rivendell. Make your ways to&#13;
         places where you can find grass, and so come in time to Elrond’s house, or wherever you wish to go.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There, Sam! He will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and getting home as we have.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. Bill, seeming to understand well what was going on, nuzzled up to him,&#13;
         putting his nose to Sam’s ear. Sam burst into tears, and fumbled with the straps, unlading all the pony’s packs and throwing&#13;
         them on the ground. The others sorted out the goods, making a pile of all that could be left behind, and dividing up the rest.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When this was done they turned to watch Gandalf. He appeared to have done nothing. He was standing between the two trees gazing&#13;
         at the blank wall of the cliff, as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes. Gimli was wandering about, tapping the stone&#13;
         here and there with his axe. Legolas was pressed against the rock, as if listening.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, here we are and all ready,’ said Merry; ‘but where are the Doors? I can’t see any sign of them.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,’ said Gimli. ‘They are invisible, and their own makers cannot find them or&#13;
         open them, if their secret is forgotten.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to Dwarves,’ said Gandalf, coming suddenly to life and turning round.&#13;
         ‘Unless things are altogether changed, eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He walked forward to the wall. Right between the shadow of the trees there was a smooth space, and over this he passed his&#13;
         hands to and fro, muttering words under his breath. Then he stepped back.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Look!’ he said. ‘Can you see anything now?’</p>&#13;
      <p>The Moon now shone upon the grey face of the rock; but they could see nothing else for a while. Then slowly on the &#13;
         <a id="page397"/>surface, where the wizard’s hands had passed, faint lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running in the stone. At&#13;
         first they were no more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the Moon caught them, but&#13;
         steadily they grew broader and clearer, until their design could be guessed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At the top, as high as Gandalf could reach, was an arch of interlacing letters in an Elvish character. Below, though the threads&#13;
         were in places blurred or broken, the outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars.&#13;
         Beneath these again were two trees, each bearing crescent moons. More clearly than all else there shone forth in the middle&#13;
         of the door a single star with many rays.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There are the emblems of Durin!’ cried Gimli.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘And there is the Tree of the High Elves!’ said Legolas.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘And the Star of the House of Fëanor,’ said Gandalf. ‘They are wrought of <em>ithildin</em> that mirrors only starlight and moonlight, and sleeps until it is touched by one who speaks words now long forgotten in Middle-earth.&#13;
         It is long since I heard them, and I thought deeply before I could recall them to my mind.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What does the writing say?’ asked Frodo, who was trying to decipher the inscription on the arch. ‘I thought I knew the elf-letters,&#13;
         but I cannot read these.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The words are in the elven-tongue of the West of Middle-earth in the Elder Days,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But they do not say&#13;
         anything of importance to us. They say only: <em>The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter.</em> And underneath small and faint is written: <em>I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs.</em>’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What does it mean by <em>speak, friend, and enter</em>?’ asked Merry.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is plain enough,’ said Gimli. ‘If you are a friend, speak the password, and the doors will open, and you can enter.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Gandalf, ‘these doors are probably governed by words. Some dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or <a id="page398"/>      <a id="page399"/> for particular persons; and some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and words are known. These&#13;
         doors have no key. In the days of Durin they were not secret. They usually stood open and doorwards sat here. But if they&#13;
         were shut, any who knew the opening word could speak it and pass in. At least so it is recorded, is it not, Gimli?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
<p class="img"><img alt="art" height="90%" src="images/Art_P398.jpg"/></p>&#13;
&#13;
      <p>‘It is,’ said the dwarf. ‘But what the word was is not remembered. Narvi and his craft and all his kindred have vanished from&#13;
         the earth.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But do not <em>you</em> know the word, Gandalf?’ asked Boromir in surprise.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No!’ said the wizard.</p>&#13;
      <p>The others looked dismayed; only Aragorn, who knew Gandalf well, remained silent and unmoved.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot?’ cried Boromir, glancing back with a shudder at the dark water.&#13;
         ‘You told us that you had once passed through the Mines. How could that be, if you did not know how to enter?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The answer to your first question, Boromir,’ said the wizard, ‘is that I do not know the word – yet. But we shall soon see.&#13;
         And,’ he added, with a glint in his eyes under their bristling brows, ‘you may ask what is the use of my deeds when they are&#13;
         proved useless. As for your other question: do you doubt my tale? Or have you no wits left? I did not enter this way. I came&#13;
         from the East.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors open outwards. From the inside you may thrust them open with your hands.&#13;
         From the outside nothing will move them save the spell of command. They cannot be forced inwards.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What are you going to do then?’ asked Pippin, undaunted by the wizard’s bristling brows.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Knock on the doors with your head, Peregrin Took,’ said Gandalf. ‘But if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little&#13;
         peace from foolish questions, I will seek for the opening words.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men &#13;
         <a id="page400"/>or Orcs, that was ever used for such a purpose. I can still remember ten score of them without searching in my mind. But only&#13;
         a few trials, I think, will be needed; and I shall not have to call on Gimli for words of the secret dwarf-tongue that they&#13;
         teach to none. The opening words were Elvish, like the writing on the arch: that seems certain.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He stepped up to the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the silver star in the middle beneath the sign of the&#13;
         anvil.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>Annon edhellen, edro hi ammen!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Fennas nogothrim, lasto beth lammen!</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="p1">he said in a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, but the blank grey stone did not stir.</p>&#13;
      <p>Many times he repeated these words in different order, or varied them. Then he tried other spells, one after another, speaking&#13;
         now faster and louder, now soft and slow. Then he spoke many single words of Elvish speech. Nothing happened. The cliff towered&#13;
         into the night, the countless stars were kindled, the wind blew cold, and the doors stood fast.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Again Gandalf approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in tones of command and rising wrath. <em>Edro, edro!</em> he cried, and struck the rock with his staff. <em>Open, open!</em> he shouted, and followed it with the same command in every language that had ever been spoken in the West of Middle-earth.&#13;
         Then he threw his staff on the ground, and sat down in silence.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At that moment from far off the wind bore to their listening ears the howling of wolves. Bill the pony started in fear, and&#13;
         Sam sprang to his side and whispered softly to him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do not let him run away!’ said Boromir. ‘It seems that we shall need him still, if the wolves do not find us. How I hate&#13;
         this foul pool!’ He stooped and picking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The stone vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant &#13;
         <a id="page401"/>there was a swish and a bubble. Great rippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where the stone had fallen, and they&#13;
         moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Why did you do that, Boromir?’ said Frodo. ‘I hate this place, too, and I am afraid. I don’t know of what: not of wolves,&#13;
         or the dark behind the doors, but of something else. I am afraid of the pool. Don’t disturb it!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wish we could get away!’ said Merry.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Why doesn’t Gandalf do something quick?’ said Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf took no notice of them. He sat with his head bowed, either in despair or in anxious thought. The mournful howling&#13;
         of the wolves was heard again. The ripples on the water grew and came closer; some were already lapping on the shore.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet. He was laughing! ‘I have it!’ he cried. ‘Of course,&#13;
         of course! Absurdly simple, like most riddles when you see the answer.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear voice: <em>Mellon!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>The star shone out briefly and faded again. Then silently a great doorway was outlined, though not a crack or joint had been&#13;
         visible before. Slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch, until both doors lay back against the wall.&#13;
         Through the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up; but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper&#13;
         than the night. The Company stared in wonder.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I was wrong after all,’ said Gandalf, ‘and Gimli too. Merry, of all people, was on the right track. The opening word was&#13;
         inscribed on the archway all the time! The translation should have been: <em>Say “Friend” and enter</em>. I had only to speak the Elvish word for <em>friend</em> and the doors opened. Quite simple. Too simple for a learned lore-master in these suspicious days. Those were happier times.&#13;
         Now let us go!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">He strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. But at that moment several things happened. Frodo felt &#13;
         <a id="page402"/>something seize him by the ankle, and he fell with a cry. Bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned tail and dashed&#13;
         away along the lakeside into the darkness. Sam leaped after him, and then hearing Frodo’s cry he ran back again, weeping and&#13;
         cursing. The others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething, as if a host of snakes were swimming up from the&#13;
         southern end.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled; it was pale-green and luminous and wet. Its fingered end had hold&#13;
         of Frodo’s foot, and was dragging him into the water. Sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The arm let go of Frodo, and Sam pulled him away, crying out for help. Twenty other arms came rippling out. The dark water&#13;
         boiled, and there was a hideous stench.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Into the gateway! Up the stairs! Quick!’ shouted Gandalf leaping back. Rousing them from the horror that seemed to have rooted&#13;
         all but Sam to the ground where they stood, he drove them forward.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They were just in time. Sam and Frodo were only a few steps up, and Gandalf had just begun to climb, when the groping tentacles&#13;
         writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff-wall and the doors. One came wriggling over the threshold, glistening&#13;
         in the starlight. Gandalf turned and paused. If he was considering what word would close the gate again from within, there&#13;
         was no need. Many coiling arms seized the doors on either side, and with horrible strength, swung them round. With a shattering&#13;
         echo they slammed, and all light was lost. A noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam, clinging to Frodo’s arm, collapsed on a step in the black darkness. ‘Poor old Bill!’ he said in a choking voice. ‘Poor&#13;
         old Bill! Wolves and snakes! But the snakes were too much for him. I had to choose, Mr. Frodo. I had to come with you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They heard Gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors. There was a quiver in the stone and the&#13;
         stairs trembled, but the doors did not open.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page403"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘Well, well!’ said the wizard. ‘The passage is blocked behind us now, and there is only one way out – on the other side of&#13;
         the mountains. I fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate.&#13;
         I am sorry; for the trees were beautiful, and had stood so long.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I felt that something horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water,’ said Frodo. ‘What was the&#13;
         thing, or were there many of them?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not know,’ answered Gandalf; ‘but the arms were all guided by one purpose. Something has crept, or has been driven out&#13;
         of dark waters under the mountains. There are older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world.’ He did not&#13;
         speak aloud his thought that whatever it was that dwelt in the lake, it had seized on Frodo first among all the Company.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir muttered under his breath, but the echoing stone magnified the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear: ‘In&#13;
         the deep places of the world! And thither we are going against my wish. Who will lead us now in this deadly dark?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will,’ said Gandalf, ‘and Gimli shall walk with me. Follow my staff!’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff aloft, and from its tip there came a faint radiance. The&#13;
         wide stairway was sound and undamaged. Two hundred steps they counted, broad and shallow; and at the top they found an arched&#13;
         passage with a level floor leading on into the dark.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing, since we can’t find a dining-room!’ said Frodo. He had&#13;
         begun to shake off the terror of the clutching arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps, dim figures in the gloom. After they had eaten, Gandalf&#13;
         gave them each a third sip of the <em>miruvor</em> of Rivendell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page404"/>&#13;
      <p>‘It will not last much longer, I am afraid,’ he said; ‘but I think we need it after that horror at the gate. And unless we&#13;
         have great luck, we shall need all that is left before we see the other side! Go carefully with the water, too! There are&#13;
         many streams and wells in the Mines, but they should not be touched. We may not have a chance of filling our skins and bottles&#13;
         till we come down into Dimrill Dale.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘How long is that going to take us?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I cannot say,’ answered Gandalf. ‘It depends on many chances. But going straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall&#13;
         take three or four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West-door to East-gate in a direct line, and&#13;
         the road may wind much.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">After only a brief rest they started on their way again. All were eager to get the journey over as quickly as possible, and&#13;
         were willing, tired as they were, to go on marching still for several hours. Gandalf walked in front as before. In his left&#13;
         hand he held up his glimmering staff, the light of which just showed the ground before his feet; in his right he held his&#13;
         sword Glamdring. Behind him came Gimli, his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side. Behind&#13;
         the dwarf walked Frodo, and he had drawn the short sword, Sting. No gleam came from the blades of Sting or of Glamdring; and&#13;
         that was some comfort, for being the work of Elvish smiths in the Elder Days these swords shone with a cold light, if any&#13;
         Orcs were near at hand. Behind Frodo went Sam, and after him Legolas, and the young hobbits, and Boromir. In the dark at the&#13;
         rear, grim and silent, walked Aragorn.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend. It went steadily down for a long while before it became&#13;
         level once again. The air grew hot and stifling, but it was not foul, and at times they felt currents of cooler air upon their&#13;
         faces, issuing from half-guessed openings in the walls. There were many of these. In the pale ray of the wizard’s staff, Frodo&#13;
         caught glimpses of stairs and arches, and of other &#13;
         <a id="page405"/>passages and tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or opening blankly dark on either side. It was bewildering beyond&#13;
         hope of remembering.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gimli aided Gandalf very little, except by his stout courage. At least he was not, as were most of the others, troubled by&#13;
         the mere darkness in itself. Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always&#13;
         Gandalf who had the final word. The Mines of Moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of Gimli, Glóin’s son, dwarf&#13;
         of the mountain-race though he was. To Gandalf the far-off memories of a journey long before were now of little help, but&#13;
         even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to go, and he did not falter, as long as&#13;
         there was a path that led towards his goal.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘Do not be afraid!’ said Aragorn. There was a pause longer than usual, and Gandalf and Gimli were whispering together; the&#13;
         others were crowded behind, waiting anxiously. ‘Do not be afraid! I have been with him on many a journey, if never on one&#13;
         so dark; and there are tales in Rivendell of greater deeds of his than any that I have seen. He will not go astray – if there&#13;
         is any path to find. He has led us in here against our fears, but he will lead us out again, at whatever cost to himself.&#13;
         He is surer of finding the way home in a blind night than the cats of Queen Berúthiel.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was well for the Company that they had such a guide. They had no fuel nor any means of making torches; in the desperate&#13;
         scramble at the doors many things had been left behind. But without any light they would soon have come to grief. There were&#13;
         not only many roads to choose from, there were also in many places holes and pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in which&#13;
         their passing feet echoed. There were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor, and every now and then a crack would open&#13;
         right before their feet. The widest was more than seven feet across, and it was long before Pippin could summon enough courage&#13;
         to leap over &#13;
         <a id="page406"/>the dreadful gap. The noise of churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was turning in the depths.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Rope!’ muttered Sam. ‘I knew I’d want it, if I hadn’t got it!’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">As these dangers became more frequent their march became slower. Already they seemed to have been tramping on, on, endlessly&#13;
         to the mountains’ roots. They were more than weary, and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywhere. Frodo’s&#13;
         spirits had risen for a while after his escape, and after food and a draught of the cordial; but now a deep uneasiness, growing&#13;
         to dread, crept over him again. Though he had been healed in Rivendell of the knife-stroke, that grim wound had not been without&#13;
         effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be seen. One sign of change that he soon had noticed&#13;
         was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions, save perhaps Gandalf. And he was in any case the bearer&#13;
         of the Ring: it hung upon its chain against his breast, and at whiles it seemed a heavy weight. He felt the certainty of evil&#13;
         ahead and of evil following; but he said nothing. He gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Company behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hurried whispers. There was no sound but the sound of their own feet:&#13;
         the dull stump of Gimli’s dwarf-boots; the heavy tread of Boromir; the light step of Legolas; the soft, scarce-heard patter&#13;
         of hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of Aragorn with his long stride. When they halted for a moment they&#13;
         heard nothing at all, unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water. Yet Frodo began to hear, or to&#13;
         imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It was never loud enough, or near enough, for&#13;
         him to feel certain that he heard it; but once it had started it never stopped, while the Company was moving. But it was not&#13;
         an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself, and then grew still.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page407"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">It was after nightfall when they had entered the Mines. They had been going for several hours with only brief halts, when&#13;
         Gandalf came to his first serious check. Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages: all led in the same&#13;
         general direction, eastwards; but the left-hand passage plunged down, while the right-hand climbed up, and the middle way&#13;
         seemed to run on, smooth and level but very narrow.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have no memory of this place at all!’ said Gandalf, standing uncertainly under the arch. He held up his staff in the hope&#13;
         of finding some marks or inscription that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was to be seen. ‘I am too weary to&#13;
         decide,’ he said, shaking his head. ‘And I expect that you are all as weary as I am, or wearier. We had better halt here for&#13;
         what is left of the night. You know what I mean! In here it is ever dark; but outside the late Moon is riding westward and&#13;
         the middle-night has passed.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Poor old Bill!’ said Sam. ‘I wonder where he is. I hope those wolves haven’t got him yet.’</p>&#13;
      <p>To the left of the great arch they found a stone door: it was half closed, but swung back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond&#13;
         there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Steady! Steady!’ cried Gandalf, as Merry and Pippin pushed forward, glad to find a place where they could rest with at least&#13;
         more feeling of shelter than in the open passage. ‘Steady! You do not know what is inside yet. I will go first.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. ‘There!’ he said, pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor.&#13;
         Before his feet they saw a large round hole like the mouth of a well. Broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed&#13;
         down into the black pit. Fragments of stone lay near.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘One of you might have fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the bottom,’ said Aragorn to Merry.&#13;
         ‘Let the guide go first while you have one.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the watching of the three passages,’ said Gimli. ‘That hole was plainly a well&#13;
         for the guards’ use, covered with a stone lid.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page408"/>&#13;
      <p>But the lid is broken, and we must all take care in the dark.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin felt curiously attracted by the well. While the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against the walls of&#13;
         the chamber, as far as possible from the hole in the floor, he crept to the edge and peered over. A chill air seemed to strike&#13;
         his face, rising from invisible depths. Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone, and let it drop. He felt his&#13;
         heart beat many times before there was any sound. Then far below, as if the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous&#13;
         place, there came a <em>plunk</em>, very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What’s that?’ cried Gandalf. He was relieved when Pippin confessed what he had done; but he was angry, and Pippin could see&#13;
         his eye glinting. ‘Fool of a Took!’ he growled. ‘This is a serious journey, not a hobbit walking-party. Throw yourself in&#13;
         next time, and then you will be no further nuisance. Now be quiet!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Nothing more was heard for several minutes; but then there came out of the depths faint knocks: <em>tom-tap</em>, <em>tap-tom</em>. They stopped, and when the echoes had died away, they were repeated: <em>tap-tom</em>, <em>tom-tap</em>, <em>tap-tap</em>, <em>tom</em>. They sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while the knocking died away and was not heard again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard one,’ said Gimli.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Gandalf, ‘and I do not like it. It may have nothing to do with Peregrin’s foolish stone; but probably something&#13;
         has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing of the kind again! Let us hope we shall get some&#13;
         rest without further trouble. You, Pippin, can go on the first watch, as a reward,’ he growled, as he rolled himself in a&#13;
         blanket.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on turning round, fearing that some unknown thing would crawl&#13;
         up out of the well. He wished he could cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he dared not move or go near it, even though&#13;
         Gandalf seemed to be asleep.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page409"/>&#13;
      <p>Actually Gandalf was awake, though lying still and silent. He was deep in thought, trying to recall every memory of his former&#13;
         journey in the Mines, and considering anxiously the next course that he should take; a false turn now might be disastrous.&#13;
         After an hour he rose up and came over to Pippin.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,’ he said in a kindly tone. ‘You want to sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink,&#13;
         so I may as well do the watching.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I know what is the matter with me,’ he muttered, as he sat down by the door. ‘I need smoke! I have not tasted it since the&#13;
         morning before the snowstorm.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The last thing that Pippin saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a&#13;
         glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose, and the puff of smoke.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">It was Gandalf who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and watched all alone for about six hours, and had let the others&#13;
         rest. ‘And in the watches I have made up my mind,’ he said. ‘I do not like the feel of the middle way; and I do not like the&#13;
         smell of the left-hand way: there is foul air down there, or I am no guide. I shall take the right-hand passage. It is time&#13;
         we began to climb up again.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>For eight dark hours, not counting two brief halts, they marched on; and they met no danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing&#13;
         but the faint gleam of the wizard’s light, bobbing like a will-o’-the-wisp in front of them. The passage they had chosen wound&#13;
         steadily upwards. As far as they could judge it went in great mounting curves, and as it rose it grew loftier and wider. There&#13;
         were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits or cracks.&#13;
         Evidently they had struck what once had been an important road; and they went forward quicker than they had done on their&#13;
         first march.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In this way they advanced some fifteen miles, measured in &#13;
         <a id="page410"/>a direct line east, though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more. As the road climbed upwards, Frodo’s spirits&#13;
         rose a little; but he still felt oppressed, and still at times he heard, or thought he heard, away behind the Company and&#13;
         beyond the fall and patter of their feet, a following footstep that was not an echo.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and all were thinking of a place where they could sleep,&#13;
         when suddenly the walls to right and left vanished. They seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black and&#13;
         empty space. There was a great draught of warmer air behind them, and before them the darkness was cold on their faces. They&#13;
         halted and crowded anxiously together.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf seemed pleased. ‘I chose the right way,’ he said. ‘At last we are coming to the habitable parts, and I guess that&#13;
         we are not far now from the eastern side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than the Dimrill Gate, unless I am mistaken.&#13;
         From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall. I will now risk a little real light.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He raised his staff, and for a brief instant there was a blaze like a flash of lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled,&#13;
         and for a second they saw a vast roof far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone. Before them and on&#13;
         either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black walls, polished and smooth as glass, flashed and glittered. Three other&#13;
         entrances they saw, dark black arches: one straight before them eastwards, and one on either side. Then the light went out.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is all that I shall venture on for the present,’ said Gandalf. ‘There used to be great windows on the mountain-side,&#13;
         and shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the Mines. I think we have reached them now, but it is night outside&#13;
         again, and we cannot tell until morning. If I am right, tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in. But in the meanwhile&#13;
         we had better go no further. Let &#13;
         <a id="page411"/>us rest, if we can. Things have gone well so far, and the greater part of the dark road is over. But we are not through yet,&#13;
         and it is a long way down to the Gates that open on the world.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Company spent that night in the great cavernous hall, huddled close together in a corner to escape the draught: there&#13;
         seemed to be a steady inflow of chill air through the eastern archway. All about them as they lay hung the darkness, hollow&#13;
         and immense, and they were oppressed by the loneliness and vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and&#13;
         passages. The wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread&#13;
         and wonder of Moria.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at one time,’ said Sam; ‘and every one of them busier than badgers for&#13;
         five hundred years to make all this, and most in hard rock too! What did they do it all for? They didn’t live in these darksome&#13;
         holes surely?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘These are not holes,’ said Gimli. ‘This is the great realm and city of the Dwarrowdelf. And of old it was not darksome, but&#13;
         full of light and splendour, as is still remembered in our songs.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice, while the echoes ran away into the roof.</p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>The world was young, the mountains green,</em></p>&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>The shadow lies upon his tomb</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>In Moria, in Khazad-dûm.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>But still the sunken stars appear</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page413"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>In dark and windless Mirrormere;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>There lies his crown in water deep,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>Till Durin wakes again from sleep.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>‘I like that!’ said Sam. ‘I should like to learn it. <em>In Moria, in Khazad-dûm!</em> But it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those lamps. Are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here&#13;
         still?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gimli was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Piles of jewels?’ said Gandalf. ‘No. The Orcs have often plundered Moria; there is nothing left in the upper halls. And since&#13;
         the dwarves fled, no one dares to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the deep places: they are drowned in water – or in&#13;
         a shadow of fear.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then what do the dwarves want to come back for?’ asked Sam.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘For <em>mithril</em>,’ answered Gandalf. ‘The wealth of Moria was not in gold and jewels, the toys of the Dwarves; nor in iron, their servant.&#13;
         Such things they found here, it is true, especially iron; but they did not need to delve for them: all things that they desired&#13;
         they could obtain in traffic. For here alone in the world was found Moria-silver, or true-silver as some have called it: <em>mithril</em> is the Elvish name. The Dwarves have a name which they do not tell. Its worth was ten times that of gold, and now it is beyond&#13;
         price; for little is left above ground, and even the Orcs dare not delve here for it. The lodes lead away north towards Caradhras,&#13;
         and down to darkness. The Dwarves tell no tale; but even as <em>mithril</em> was the foundation of their wealth, so also it was their destruction: they delved too greedily and too deep, and disturbed&#13;
         that from which they fled, Durin’s Bane. Of what they brought to light the Orcs have gathered nearly all, and given it in&#13;
         tribute to Sauron, who covets it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>Mithril!</em> All folk desired it. It could be beaten like copper, and polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make of it a metal, light&#13;
         and yet harder than tempered steel. Its beauty &#13;
         <a id="page414"/>was like to that of common silver, but the beauty of <em>mithril</em> did not tarnish or grow dim. The Elves dearly loved it, and among many uses they made of it <em>ithildin</em>, starmoon, which you saw upon the doors. Bilbo had a corslet of mithril-rings that Thorin gave him. I wonder what has become&#13;
         of it? Gathering dust still in Michel Delving Mathom-house, I suppose.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What?’ cried Gimli, startled out of his silence. ‘A corslet of Moria-silver? That was a kingly gift!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Gandalf. ‘I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of the whole Shire and everything in it.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the rings of his mail-shirt. He felt staggered to think&#13;
         that he had been walking about with the price of the Shire under his jacket. Had Bilbo known? He felt no doubt that Bilbo&#13;
         knew quite well. It was indeed a kingly gift. But now his thoughts had been carried away from the dark Mines, to Rivendell,&#13;
         to Bilbo, and to Bag End in the days while Bilbo was still there. He wished with all his heart that he was back there, and&#13;
         in those days, mowing the lawn, or pottering among the flowers, and that he had never heard of Moria, or <em>mithril</em> – or the Ring.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">A deep silence fell. One by one the others fell asleep. Frodo was on guard. As if it were a breath that came in through unseen&#13;
         doors out of deep places, dread came over him. His hands were cold and his brow damp. He listened. All his mind was given&#13;
         to listening and nothing else for two slow hours; but he heard no sound, not even the imagined echo of a footfall.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>His watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that the western archway stood, he fancied that he could see two&#13;
         pale points of light, almost like luminous eyes. He started. His head had nodded. ‘I must have nearly fallen asleep on guard,’&#13;
         he thought. ‘I was on the edge of a dream.’ He stood up and rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, peering into the dark,&#13;
         until he was relieved by Legolas.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page415"/>&#13;
      <p>When he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him that the dream went on: he heard whispers, and saw the two&#13;
         pale points of light approaching, slowly. He woke and found that the others were speaking softly near him, and that a dim&#13;
         light was falling on his face. High up above the eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam; and&#13;
         across the hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo sat up. ‘Good morning!’ said Gandalf. ‘For morning it is again at last. I was right, you see. We are high up on the&#13;
         east side of Moria. Before today is over we ought to find the Great Gates and see the waters of Mirrormere lying in the Dimrill&#13;
         Dale before us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I shall be glad,’ said Gimli. ‘I have looked on Moria, and it is very great, but it has become dark and dreadful; and we&#13;
         have found no sign of my kindred. I doubt now that Balin ever came here.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">After they had breakfasted Gandalf decided to go on again at once. ‘We are tired, but we shall rest better when we are outside,’&#13;
         he said. ‘I think that none of us will wish to spend another night in Moria.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No indeed!’ said Boromir. ‘Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward arch?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Maybe,’ said Gandalf. ‘But I do not know yet exactly where we are. Unless I am quite astray, I guess that we are above and&#13;
         to the north of the Great Gates; and it may not be easy to find the right road down to them. The eastern arch will probably&#13;
         prove to be the way that we must take; but before we make up our minds we ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light&#13;
         in the north door. If we could find a window it would help, but I fear that the light comes only down deep shafts.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Following his lead the Company passed under the northern arch. They found themselves in a wide corridor. As they went along&#13;
         it the glimmer grew stronger, and they saw that it came through a doorway on their right. It was high and flat-topped, &#13;
         <a id="page416"/>and the stone door was still upon its hinges, standing half open. Beyond it was a large square chamber. It was dimly lit,&#13;
         but to their eyes, after so long a time in the dark, it seemed dazzlingly bright, and they blinked as they entered.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose shapes they could not&#13;
         at first make out. The chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it slanted upwards and, far above,&#13;
         a small square patch of blue sky could be seen. The light of the shaft fell directly on a table in the middle of the room:&#13;
         a single oblong block, about two feet high, upon which was laid a great slab of white stone.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It looks like a tomb,’ muttered Frodo, and bent forwards with a curious sense of foreboding, to look more closely at it.&#13;
         Gandalf came quickly to his side. On the slab runes were deeply graven:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="img"><img alt="art" src="images/Art_P416.jpg" width="60%"/></p>&#13;
      <a id="page417"/>&#13;
      <p>‘These are Daeron’s Runes, such as were used of old in Moria,’ said Gandalf. ‘Here is written in the tongues of Men and Dwarves:</p>&#13;
      <p class="dt4"><small>BALIN SON OF FUNDIN LORD OF MORIA.’</small></p>&#13;
      <p>‘He is dead then,’ said Frodo. ‘I feared it was so.’ Gimli cast his hood over his face.</p>&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-17">THE BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DÛM</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">The Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin. Frodo thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf,&#13;
         and of Balin’s visit to the Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the&#13;
         other side of the world.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for anything that would give them tidings of Balin’s fate, or show&#13;
         what had become of his folk. There was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under the shaft. By both the&#13;
         doors they could now see that many bones were lying, and among them were broken swords and axe-heads, and cloven shields and&#13;
         helms. Some of the swords were crooked: orc-scimitars with blackened blades.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were large iron-bound chests of wood. All had been broken&#13;
         and plundered; but beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book. It had been slashed and stabbed and partly&#13;
         burned, and it was so stained with black and other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read. Gandalf lifted&#13;
         it carefully, but the leaves cracked and broke as he laid it on the slab. He pored over it for some time without speaking.&#13;
         Frodo and Gimli standing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they were written by many different&#13;
         hands, in runes, both of Moria and of Dale, and here and there in Elvish script.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At last Gandalf looked up. ‘It seems to be a record of the fortunes of Balin’s folk,’ he said. ‘I guess that it began with&#13;
         their coming to Dimrill Dale nigh on thirty years ago: the pages seem to have numbers referring to the years after their &#13;
         <a id="page419"/>arrival. The top page is marked <em>one – three</em>, so at least two are missing from the beginning. Listen to this!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>We drove out orcs from the great gate and guard</em> – I think; the next word is blurred and burned: probably <em>room – we slew many in the bright</em> – I think – <em>sun in the dale. Flói was killed by an arrow. He slew the great</em>. Then there is a blur followed by <em>Flói under grass near Mirror mere</em>. The next line or two I cannot read. Then comes <em>We have taken the twentyfirst hall of North end to dwell in. There is</em> I cannot read what. A <em>shaft</em> is mentioned. Then <em>Balin has set up his seat in the Chamber of Mazarbul.</em>’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The Chamber of Records,’ said Gimli. ‘I guess that is where we now stand.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, I can read no more for a long way,’ said Gandalf, ‘except the word <em>gold</em>, and <em>Durin’s Axe</em> and something <em>helm</em>. Then <em>Balin is now lord of Moria</em>. That seems to end a chapter. After some stars another hand begins, and I can see <em>we found truesilver</em>, and later the word <em>wellforged</em>, and then something, I have it! <em>mithril</em>; and the last two lines <em>Óin<sub/>to seek for the upper armouries of Third Deep</em>, something <em>go westwards</em>, a blur, <em>to Hollin gate</em>.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside. ‘There are several pages of the same sort, rather hastily written and much damaged,’&#13;
         he said; ‘but I can make little of them in this light. Now there must be a number of leaves missing, because they begin to&#13;
         be numbered <em>five</em>, the fifth year of the colony, I suppose. Let me see! No, they are too cut and stained; I cannot read them. We might do better&#13;
         in the sunlight. Wait! Here is something: a large bold hand using an Elvish script.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That would be Ori’s hand,’ said Gimli, looking over the wizard’s arm. ‘He could write well and speedily, and often used the&#13;
         Elvish characters.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand,’ said Gandalf. ‘The first clear word is <em>sorrow</em>, but the rest of the line is lost, unless it ends in <em>estre</em>. Yes, it must be <em>yestre</em> followed by <em>day being the tenth of novembre Balin lord of Moria</em> <a id="page420"/><em>fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone to look in Mirror mere. an orc shot him from behind a stone. we slew the orc, but many&#13;
            more</em></p>&#13;
      <p><em>. . . up from east up the Silverlode.</em> The remainder of the page is so blurred that I can hardly make anything out, but I think I can read <em>we have barred the gates</em>, and then <em>can hold them long if</em>, and then perhaps <em>horrible</em> and <em>suffer</em>. Poor Balin! He seems to have kept the title that he took for less than five years. I wonder what happened afterwards; but&#13;
         there is no time to puzzle out the last few pages. Here is the last page of all.’ He paused and sighed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is grim reading,’ he said. ‘I fear their end was cruel. Listen! <em>We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the Bridge and second hall. Frár and Lóni and Náli fell there.</em> Then there are four lines smeared so that I can only read <em>went 5 days ago</em>. The last lines run <em>the pool is up to the wall at Westgate. The Watcher in the Water took Óin<sub>.</sub>We cannot get out. The end comes</em>, and then <em>drums, drums in the deep</em>. I wonder what that means. The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf-letters: <em>they are coming</em>. There is nothing more.’ Gandalf paused and stood in silent thought.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company. ‘<em>We cannot get out</em>,’ muttered Gimli. ‘It was well for us that the pool had sunk a little, and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern&#13;
         end.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gandalf raised his head and looked round. ‘They seem to have made a last stand by both doors,’ he said; ‘but there were not&#13;
         many left by that time. So ended the attempt to retake Moria! It was valiant but foolish. The time is not come yet. Now, I&#13;
         fear, we must say farewell to Balin son of Fundin. Here he must lie in the halls of his fathers. We will take this book, the&#13;
         Book of Mazarbul, and look at it more closely later. You had better keep it, Gimli, and take it back to Dáin, if you get a&#13;
         chance. It will interest him, though it will grieve him deeply. Come, let us go! The morning is passing.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Which way shall we go?’ asked Boromir. ‘Back to the hall,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But our visit to this room has not been in&#13;
         vain. I now know where we are. This &#13;
         <a id="page421"/>must be, as Gimli says, the Chamber of Mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the North-end. Therefore we should&#13;
         leave by the eastern arch of the hall, and bear right and south, and go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall should be on the&#13;
         Seventh Level, that is six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a rolling <em>Boom</em> that seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in the stone at their feet. They sprang towards the door in alarm.&#13;
         <em>Doom</em>, <em>doom</em> it rolled again, as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of Moria into a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast:&#13;
         a great horn was blown in the hall, and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off. There was a hurrying sound&#13;
         of many feet.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘They are coming!’ cried Legolas.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We cannot get out,’ said Gimli.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Trapped!’ cried Gandalf. ‘Why did I delay? Here we are, caught, just as they were before. But I was not here then. We will&#13;
         see what——’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>Doom</em>, <em>doom</em> came the drum-beat and the walls shook. ‘Slam the doors and wedge them!’ shouted Aragorn. ‘And keep your packs on as long&#13;
         as you can: we may get a chance to cut our way out yet.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No!’ said Gandalf. ‘We must not get shut in. Keep the east door ajar! We will go that way, if we get a chance.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Another harsh horn-call and shrill cries rang out. Feet were coming down the corridor. There was a ring and clatter as the&#13;
         Company drew their swords. Glamdring shone with a pale light, and Sting glinted at the edges. Boromir set his shoulder against&#13;
         the western door.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Wait a moment! Do not close it yet!’ said Gandalf. He sprang forward to Boromir’s side and drew himself up to his full height.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who comes hither to disturb the rest of Balin Lord of Moria?’ he cried in a loud voice.</p>&#13;
      <p>There was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of sliding &#13;
         <a id="page422"/>stones into a pit; amid the clamour a deep voice was raised in command. <em>Doom</em>, <em>boom</em>, <em>doom</em> went the drums in the deep.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>With a quick movement Gandalf stepped before the narrow opening of the door and thrust forward his staff. There was a dazzling&#13;
         flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside. For an instant the wizard looked out. Arrows whined and whistled down&#13;
         the corridor as he sprang back.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There are Orcs, very many of them,’ he said. ‘And some are large and evil: black Uruks of Mordor. For the moment they are&#13;
         hanging back, but there is something else there. A great cave-troll, I think, or more than one. There is no hope of escape&#13;
         that way.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And no hope at all, if they come at the other door as well,’ said Boromir.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is no sound outside here yet,’ said Aragorn, who was standing by the eastern door listening. ‘The passage on this side&#13;
         plunges straight down a stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But it is no good flying blindly this way with&#13;
         the pursuit just behind. We cannot block the door. Its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it opens inwards. We must do&#13;
         something to delay the enemy first. We will make them fear the Chamber of Mazarbul!’ he said grimly, feeling the edge of his&#13;
         sword, Andúril.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Heavy feet were heard in the corridor. Boromir flung himself against the door and heaved it to; then he wedged it with broken&#13;
         sword-blades and splinters of wood. The Company retreated to the other side of the chamber. But they had no chance to fly&#13;
         yet. There was a blow on the door that made it quiver; and then it began to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A&#13;
         huge arm and shoulder, with a dark skin of greenish scales, was thrust through the widening gap. Then a great, flat, toeless&#13;
         foot was forced through below. There was a dead silence outside.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his sword rang, glanced aside, and fell from his shaken&#13;
         hand. The blade was notched.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page423"/>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in his heart. ‘The Shire!’ he cried, and springing beside&#13;
         Boromir, he stooped, and stabbed with Sting at the hideous foot. There was a bellow, and the foot jerked back, nearly wrenching&#13;
         Sting from Frodo’s arm. Black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the floor. Boromir hurled himself against the door&#13;
         and slammed it again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘One for the Shire!’ cried Aragorn. ‘The hobbit’s bite is deep! You have a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo!’</p>&#13;
      <p>There was a crash on the door, followed by crash after crash. Rams and hammers were beating against it. It cracked and staggered&#13;
         back, and the opening grew suddenly wide. Arrows came whistling in, but struck the northern wall, and fell harmlessly to the&#13;
         floor. There was a horn-blast and a rush of feet, and orcs one after another leaped into the chamber.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>How many there were the Company could not count. The affray was sharp, but the orcs were dismayed by the fierceness of the&#13;
         defence. Legolas shot two through the throat. Gimli hewed the legs from under another that had sprung up on Balin’s tomb.&#13;
         Boromir and Aragorn slew many. When thirteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking, leaving the defenders unharmed, except for&#13;
         Sam who had a scratch along the scalp. A quick duck had saved him; and he had felled his orc: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade.&#13;
         A fire was smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made Ted Sandyman step backwards, if he had seen it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now is the time!’ cried Gandalf. ‘Let us go, before the troll returns!’</p>&#13;
      <p>But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the stair outside, a huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high,&#13;
         clad in black mail from head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind him his followers clustered in the doorway. His broad&#13;
         flat face was swart, his eyes were like coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With a thrust of his huge&#13;
         hide shield he turned Boromir’s sword and bore him backwards, throwing him to the ground. Diving under Aragorn’s blow with&#13;
         the speed of a striking snake he &#13;
         <a id="page424"/>charged into the Company and thrust with his spear straight at Frodo. The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was&#13;
         hurled against the wall and pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the spear-shaft, and it broke. But even as the orc flung down&#13;
         the truncheon and swept out his scimitar, Andúril came down upon his helm. There was a flash like flame and the helm burst&#13;
         asunder. The orc fell with cloven head. His followers fled howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>Doom</em>, <em>doom</em> went the drums in the deep. The great voice rolled out again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now!’ shouted Gandalf. ‘Now is the last chance. Run for it!’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Aragorn picked up Frodo where he lay by the wall and made for the stair, pushing Merry and Pippin in front of him. The others&#13;
         followed; but Gimli had to be dragged away by Legolas: in spite of the peril he lingered by Balin’s tomb with his head bowed.&#13;
         Boromir hauled the eastern door to, grinding upon its hinges: it had great iron rings on either side, but could not be fastened.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am all right,’ gasped Frodo. ‘I can walk. Put me down!’ Aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement. ‘I thought you were&#13;
         dead!’ he cried.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not yet!’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is no time for wonder. Off you go, all of you, down the stairs! Wait a few minutes for&#13;
         me at the bottom, but if I do not come soon, go on! Go quickly and choose paths leading right and downwards.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We cannot leave you to hold the door alone!’ said Aragorn. ‘Do as I say!’ said Gandalf fiercely. ‘Swords are no more use&#13;
         here. Go!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They groped their way down a long flight of steps, and then looked back;&#13;
         but they could see nothing, except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizard’s staff. He seemed to be still standing&#13;
         on guard by the closed door. Frodo breathed heavily &#13;
         <a id="page425"/>and leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They stood peering up the stairs into the darkness. Frodo thought he could&#13;
         hear the voice of Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo. He could not catch what&#13;
         was said. The walls seemed to be trembling. Every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: <em>doom</em>, <em>doom</em>.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light. Then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thud. The drum-beats&#13;
         broke out wildly: <em>doom-boom</em>, <em>doom-boom</em>, and then stopped. Gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the Company.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, well! That’s over!’ said the wizard struggling to his feet. ‘I have done all that I could. But I have met my match,&#13;
         and have nearly been destroyed. But don’t stand here! Go on! You will have to do without light for a while: I am rather shaken.&#13;
         Go on! Go on! Where are you, Gimli? Come ahead with me! Keep close behind, all of you!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They stumbled after him wondering what had happened. <em>Doom</em>, <em>doom</em> went the drum-beats again: they now sounded muffled and far away, but they were following. There was no other sound of pursuit,&#13;
         neither tramp of feet, nor any voice. Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to be going in the direction&#13;
         that he desired. Every now and again it descended a flight of steps, fifty or more, to a lower level. At the moment that was&#13;
         their chief danger; for in the dark they could not see a descent, until they came on it and put their feet out into emptiness.&#13;
         Gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and had descended many flights of stairs. There was still&#13;
         no sound of pursuit. Almost they began to hope that they would escape. At the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is getting hot!’ he gasped. ‘We ought to be down at least to the level of the Gates now. Soon I think we should look &#13;
         <a id="page426"/>for a left-hand turn to take us east. I hope it is not far. I am very weary. I must rest here a moment, even if all the orcs&#13;
         ever spawned are after us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gimli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step. ‘What happened away up there at the door?’ he asked. ‘Did you&#13;
         meet the beater of the drums?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not know,’ answered Gandalf. ‘But I found myself suddenly faced by something that I have not met before. I could think&#13;
         of nothing to do but to try and put a shutting-spell on the door. I know many; but to do things of that kind rightly requires&#13;
         time, and even then the door can be broken by strength.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘As I stood there I could hear orc-voices on the other side: at any moment I thought they would burst it open. I could not&#13;
         hear what was said; they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language. All I caught was <em>ghâsh</em>: that is “fire”. Then something came into the chamber – I felt it through the door, and the orcs themselves were afraid and&#13;
         fell silent. It laid hold of the iron ring, and then it perceived me and my spell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge. The counter-spell was terrible. It nearly broke me. For&#13;
         an instant the door left my control and began to open! I had to speak a word of Command. That proved too great a strain. The&#13;
         door burst in pieces. Something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the light inside, and I was thrown backwards down the&#13;
         stairs. All the wall gave way, and the roof of the chamber as well, I think.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am afraid Balin is buried deep, and maybe something else is buried there too. I cannot say. But at least the passage behind&#13;
         us was completely blocked. Ah! I have never felt so spent, but it is passing. And now what about you, Frodo? There was not&#13;
         time to say so, but I have never been more delighted in my life than when you spoke. I feared that it was a brave but dead&#13;
         hobbit that Aragorn was carrying.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What about me?’ said Frodo. ‘I am alive, and whole I think. I am bruised and in pain, but it is not too bad.’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page427"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Well,’ said Aragorn, ‘I can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that I have never met the like of it. Had&#13;
         I known, I would have spoken softer in the Inn at Bree! That spear-thrust would have skewered a wild boar!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,’ said Frodo; ‘though I feel as if I had been caught between a hammer and an&#13;
         anvil.’ He said no more. He found breathing painful.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You take after Bilbo,’ said Gandalf. ‘There is more about you than meets the eye, as I said of him long ago.’ Frodo wondered&#13;
         if the remark meant more than it said.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They now went on again. Before long Gimli spoke. He had keen eyes in the dark. ‘I think,’ he said, ‘that there is a light&#13;
         ahead. But it is not daylight. It is red. What can it be?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>Ghâsh!</em>’ muttered Gandalf. ‘I wonder if that is what they meant: that the lower levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Soon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all. It was flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage&#13;
         before them. They could now see their way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way ahead there stood a low archway;&#13;
         through it the growing light came. The air became very hot.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When they came to the arch Gandalf went through, signing to them to wait. As he stood just beyond the opening they saw his&#13;
         face lit by a red glow. Quickly he stepped back.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is some new devilry here,’ he said, ‘devised for our welcome, no doubt. But I know now where we are: we have reached&#13;
         the First Deep, the level immediately below the Gates. This is the Second Hall of Old Moria; and the Gates are near: away&#13;
         beyond the eastern end, on the left, not more than a quarter of a mile. Across the Bridge, up a broad stair, along a wide&#13;
         road, through the First Hall, and out! But come and look!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept.&#13;
         They were near its eastern end; westward it ran away &#13;
         <a id="page428"/>into darkness. Down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees whose&#13;
         boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems were smooth and black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored&#13;
         in their sides. Right across the floor, close to the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had opened. Out of it a fierce&#13;
         red light came, and now and again flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps of dark smoke&#13;
         wavered in the hot air.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should have been trapped here,’ said Gandalf. ‘Let us hope&#13;
         that the fire now lies between us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: <em>Doom</em>, <em>doom</em>, <em>doom</em>. Away beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came cries and horn-calls. <em>Doom, doom</em>: the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now for the last race!’ said Gandalf. ‘If the sun is shining outside, we may still escape. After me!’</p>&#13;
      <p>He turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall. The distance was greater than it had looked. As they ran they&#13;
         heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind. A shrill yell went up: they had been seen. There was a ring and clash&#13;
         of steel. An arrow whistled over Frodo’s head.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir laughed. ‘They did not expect this,’ he said. ‘The fire has cut them off. We are on the wrong side!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Look ahead!’ called Gandalf. ‘The Bridge is near. It is dangerous and narrow.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly Frodo saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the hall the floor vanished and fell to an unknown depth. The outer&#13;
         door could only be reached by a slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, that spanned the chasm with one curving spring&#13;
         of fifty feet. It was an ancient defence of the Dwarves against any enemy that might capture the First Hall and the outer&#13;
         passages. They could only pass across it in single file. At the brink Gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page429"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Lead the way, Gimli!’ he said. ‘Pippin and Merry next. Straight on, and up the stair beyond the door!’</p>&#13;
      <p>Arrows fell among them. One struck Frodo and sprang back. Another pierced Gandalf ’s hat and stuck there like a black feather.&#13;
         Frodo looked behind. Beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures: there seemed to be hundreds of orcs. They brandished spears&#13;
         and scimitars which shone red as blood in the firelight. <em>Doom</em>, <em>doom</em> rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and louder, <em>doom</em>, <em>doom</em>.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a long shot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and&#13;
         the arrow slipped to the ground. He gave a cry of dismay and fear. Two great trolls appeared; they bore great slabs of stone,&#13;
         and flung them down to serve as gangways over the fire. But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with terror. The&#13;
         ranks of the orcs had opened, and they crowded away, as if they themselves were afraid. Something was coming up behind them.&#13;
         What it was could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet&#13;
         greater; and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the&#13;
         fissure. The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air. Its streaming mane&#13;
         kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of&#13;
         many thongs.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ai! ai!’ wailed Legolas. ‘A Balrog! A Balrog is come!’ Gimli stared with wide eyes. ‘Durin’s Bane!’ he cried, and letting&#13;
         his axe fall he covered his face.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘A Balrog,’ muttered Gandalf. ‘Now I understand.’ He faltered and leaned heavily on his staff. ‘What an evil fortune! And&#13;
         I am already weary.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways. then &#13;
         <a id="page430"/>Boromir raised his horn and blew. Loud the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout of many throats under the cavernous&#13;
         roof. For a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted. Then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by&#13;
         a dark wind, and the enemy advanced again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Over the bridge!’ cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. ‘Fly! This is a foe beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way.&#13;
         Fly!’ Aragorn and Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side, behind Gandalf at the far end&#13;
         of the bridge. The others halted just within the doorway at the hall’s end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to face&#13;
         the enemy alone.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his&#13;
         other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like&#13;
         two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You cannot pass,’ he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. ‘I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of&#13;
         the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge,&#13;
         and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be&#13;
         seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset&#13;
         of a storm.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming. Glamdring glittered white in answer. There was a ringing clash and a stab&#13;
         of white fire. The Balrog fell back, and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the bridge, stepped back&#13;
         a pace, and then again stood still.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page431"/>&#13;
      <p>‘You cannot pass!’ he said.</p>&#13;
      <p>With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled and hissed.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘He cannot stand alone!’ cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge. ‘<em>Elendil!</em>’ he shouted. ‘I am with you, Gandalf!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Gondor!’ cried Boromir and leaped after him. At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the bridge&#13;
         before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked.&#13;
         Right at the Balrog’s feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf, while the rest remained, poised,&#13;
         quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip,&#13;
         and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard’s knees, dragging him to the brink. He staggered and fell, grasped vainly&#13;
         at the stone, and slid into the abyss. ‘Fly, you fools!’ he cried, and was gone.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted with horror staring into the pit. Even as Aragorn and&#13;
         Boromir came flying back, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell. With a cry Aragorn roused them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come! I will lead you now!’ he called. ‘We must obey his last command. Follow me!’</p>&#13;
      <p>They stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door, Aragorn leading, Boromir at the rear. At the top was a wide echoing&#13;
         passage. Along this they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, and then he found that he himself was weeping as he ran.&#13;
         <em>Doom</em>, <em>doom</em>, <em>doom</em> the drum-beats rolled behind, mournful now and slow; <em>doom!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>They ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof. They ran swifter. They passed into a hall, bright&#13;
         with daylight from its high windows in the east. They fled across it. Through its huge broken doors they passed, &#13;
         <a id="page432"/>and suddenly before them the Great Gates opened, an arch of blazing light.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great door-posts towering on either side, but the gates were&#13;
         shattered and cast down. Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path, and the rest fled in terror of his&#13;
         wrath. The Company swept past them and took no heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the huge and age-worn&#13;
         steps, the threshold of Moria.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on their faces.</p>&#13;
      <p>They did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls. Dimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow of the Misty Mountains&#13;
         lay upon it, but eastwards there was a golden light on the land. It was but one hour after noon. The sun was shining; the&#13;
         clouds were white and high.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under the mountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the&#13;
         slow drum-beats: <em>doom</em>. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else was to be seen; the dale all around was empty. <em>Doom</em>. Grief at last wholly overcame them, and they wept long: some standing and silent, some cast upon the ground. <em>Doom, doom</em>. The drum-beats faded.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-18">LOTHLÓRIEN</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">‘Alas! I fear we cannot stay here longer,’ said Aragorn. He looked towards the mountains and held up his sword. ‘Farewell,&#13;
         Gandalf!’ he cried. ‘Did I not say to you: <em>if you pass the doors of Moria, beware</em>? Alas that I spoke true! What hope have we without you?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He turned to the Company. ‘We must do without hope,’ he said. ‘At least we may yet be avenged. Let us gird ourselves and weep&#13;
         no more! Come! We have a long road, and much to do.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They rose and looked about them. Northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows between two great arms of the mountains,&#13;
         above which three white peaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras, the Mountains of Moria. At the head of the glen&#13;
         a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls, and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains’&#13;
         feet.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yonder is the Dimrill Stair,’ said Aragorn, pointing to the falls. ‘Down the deep-cloven way that climbs beside the torrent&#13;
         we should have come, if fortune had been kinder.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Or Caradhras less cruel,’ said Gimli. ‘There he stands smiling in the sun!’ He shook his fist at the furthest of the snow-capped&#13;
         peaks and turned away.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end, and far lands could be descried beyond them, wide and&#13;
         vague. To the south the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. Less than a mile away, and a little&#13;
         below them, for they still stood high up on the west side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like&#13;
         a great spear-head thrust deep into the northern glen; but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the &#13;
         <a id="page434"/>sunlit sky. Yet its waters were dark: a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was still and&#13;
         unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides to its bare unbroken rim.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There lies the Mirrormere, deep Kheled-zâram!’ said Gimli sadly. ‘I remember that he said: “May you have joy of the sight!&#13;
         But we cannot linger there.” Now long shall I journey ere I have joy again. It is I that must hasten away, and he that must&#13;
         remain.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Company now went down the road from the Gates. It was rough and broken, fading to a winding track between heather and&#13;
         whin that thrust amid the cracking stones. But still it could be seen that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards&#13;
         from the lowlands to the Dwarf-kingdom. In places there were ruined works of stone beside the path, and mounds of green topped&#13;
         with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in the wind. An eastward bend led them hard by the sward of Mirrormere, and there&#13;
         not far from the roadside stood a single column broken at the top.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is Durin’s Stone!’ cried Gimli. ‘I cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to look at the wonder of the dale!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Be swift then!’ said Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates. ‘The Sun sinks early. The Orcs will not, maybe, come out till&#13;
         after dusk, but we must be far away before nightfall. The Moon is almost spent, and it will be dark tonight.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come with me, Frodo!’ cried the dwarf, springing from the road. ‘I would not have you go without seeing Kheledzâram.’ He&#13;
         ran down the long green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and weariness; Sam came&#13;
         up behind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Beside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It was cracked and weather-worn, and the faint runes upon its side could&#13;
         not be read. ‘This pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in the Mirrormere,’ said the dwarf. ‘Let us look ourselves&#13;
         once, ere we go!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They stooped over the dark water. At first they could see &#13;
         <a id="page435"/>nothing. Then slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound blue, and the peaks were like plumes&#13;
         of white flame above them; beyond there was a space of sky. There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars, though&#13;
         sunlight was in the sky above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘O Kheled-zâram fair and wonderful!’ said Gimli. ‘There lies the Crown of Durin till he wakes. Farewell!’ He bowed, and turned&#13;
         away, and hastened back up the greensward to the road again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What did you see?’ said Pippin to Sam, but Sam was too deep in thought to answer.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from between the arms of the dale. Some way below the mere&#13;
         they came on a deep well of water, clear as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling&#13;
         down a steep rocky channel.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here is the spring from which the Silverlode rises,’ said Gimli. ‘Do not drink of it! It is icy cold.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers water from many other mountain-streams,’ said Aragorn. ‘Our road leads beside&#13;
         it for many miles. For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose, and first I hope to come to the woods where the Silverlode&#13;
         flows into the Great River – out yonder.’ They looked as he pointed, and before them they could see the stream leaping down&#13;
         to the trough of the valley, and then running on and away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden haze.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There lie the woods of Lothlórien!’ said Legolas. ‘That is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees&#13;
         like the trees of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not till the spring comes and the&#13;
         new green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and&#13;
         golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood&#13;
         &#13;
         <a id="page436"/>say. My heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>that wood, and it were springtime!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘My heart will be glad, even in the winter,’ said Aragorn. ‘But it lies many miles away. Let us hasten!’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">For some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others; but Aragorn was leading them at a great pace, and after a&#13;
         while they lagged behind. They had eaten nothing since the early morning. Sam’s cut was burning like fire, and his head felt&#13;
         light. In spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt every step&#13;
         more painful and he gasped for breath.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At last Legolas turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke to Aragorn. The others halted, and Aragorn ran back, calling&#13;
         to Boromir to come with him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am sorry, Frodo!’ he cried, full of concern. ‘So much has happened this day and we have such need of haste, that I have&#13;
         forgotten that you were hurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done nothing to ease you, as we ought, though all&#13;
         the orcs of Moria were after us. Come now! A little further on there is a place where we can rest for a little. There I will&#13;
         do what I can for you. Come, Boromir! We will carry them.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the west, and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying&#13;
         Silverlode. Together they plunged over a fall of green-hued stone, and foamed down into a dell. About it stood fir-trees,&#13;
         short and bent, and its sides were steep and clothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of whortle-berry. At the bottom there was&#13;
         a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles. Here they rested. It was now nearly three hours&#13;
         after noon, and they had come only a few miles from the Gates. Already the sun was westering.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo.&#13;
         Sam’s wound was not deep, but it looked ugly, &#13;
         <a id="page437"/>and Aragorn’s face was grave as he examined it. After a moment he looked up with relief.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good luck, Sam!’ he said. ‘Many have received worse than this in payment for the slaying of their first orc. The cut is not&#13;
         poisoned, as the wounds of orc-blades too often are. It should heal well when I have tended it. Bathe it when Gimli has heated&#13;
         water.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. ‘They are dry, and some of their virtue has gone,’ he said, ‘but here&#13;
         I have still some of the leaves of <em>athelas</em> that I gathered near Weathertop. Crush one in the water, and wash the wound clean, and I will bind it. Now it is your turn,&#13;
         Frodo!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am all right,’ said Frodo, reluctant to have his garments touched. ‘All I needed was some food and a little rest.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No!’ said Aragorn. ‘We must have a look and see what the hammer and the anvil have done to you. I still marvel that you are&#13;
         alive at all.’ Gently he stripped off Frodo’s old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of wonder. Then he laughed. The silver&#13;
         corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took it off and held it up, and the gems&#13;
         on it glittered like stars, and the sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of rain in a pool.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Look, my friends!’ he called. ‘Here’s a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an elven-princeling in! If it were known that hobbits&#13;
         had such hides, all the hunters of Middle-earth would be riding to the Shire.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain,’ said Gimli, gazing at the mail in wonder. ‘It is a&#13;
         mithril-coat. Mithril! I have never seen or heard tell of one so fair. Is this the coat that Gandalf spoke of? Then he undervalued&#13;
         it. But it was well given!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have often wondered what you and Bilbo were doing, so close in his little room,’ said Merry. ‘Bless the old hobbit! I love&#13;
         him more than ever. I hope we get a chance of telling him about it!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page438"/>&#13;
      <p>There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo’s right side and breast. Under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather,&#13;
         but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the flesh. Frodo’s left side also was scored and bruised where&#13;
         he had been hurled against the wall. While the others set the food ready, Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which <em>athelas</em> was steeped. The pungent fragrance filled the dell, and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and&#13;
         strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the pain leave him, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore to the touch for&#13;
         many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The mail is marvellously light,’ he said. ‘Put it on again, if you can bear it. My heart is glad to know that you have such&#13;
         a coat. Do not lay it aside, even in sleep, unless fortune brings you where you are safe for a while; and that will seldom&#13;
         chance while your quest lasts.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">When they had eaten, the Company got ready to go on. They put out the fire and hid all traces of it. Then climbing out of&#13;
         the dell they took to the road again. They had not gone far before the sun sank behind the westward heights and great shadows&#13;
         crept down the mountain-sides. Dusk veiled their feet, and mist rose in the hollows. Away in the east the evening light lay&#13;
         pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood. Sam and Frodo now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at&#13;
         a fair pace, and with only one brief halt Aragorn led the Company on for nearly three more hours.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was dark. Deep night had fallen. There were many clear stars, but the fast-waning moon would not be seen till late. Gimli&#13;
         and Frodo were at the rear, walking softly and not speaking, listening for any sound upon the road behind. At length Gimli&#13;
         broke the silence.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not a sound but the wind,’ he said. ‘There are no goblins near, or my ears are made of wood. It is to be hoped that the Orcs&#13;
         will be content with driving us from Moria. And maybe &#13;
         <a id="page439"/>that was all their purpose, and they had nothing else to do with us – with the Ring. Though Orcs will often pursue foes for&#13;
         many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade was dull. Yet he had heard something, or thought he had. As soon as&#13;
         the shadows had fallen about them and the road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter of feet. Even now he heard&#13;
         it. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams of light behind, or for a moment he thought he saw them, but at once they&#13;
         slipped aside and vanished.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What is it?’ said the dwarf.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I don’t know,’ answered Frodo. ‘I thought I heard feet, and I thought I saw a light – like eyes. I have thought so often,&#13;
         since we first entered Moria.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gimli halted and stooped to the ground. ‘I hear nothing but the night-speech of plant and stone,’ he said. ‘Come! Let us hurry!&#13;
         The others are out of sight.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The night-wind blew chill up the valley to meet them. Before them a wide grey shadow loomed, and they heard an endless rustle&#13;
         of leaves like poplars in the breeze.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Lothlórien!’ cried Legolas. ‘Lothlórien! We have come to the eaves of the Golden Wood. Alas that it is winter!’</p>&#13;
      <p>Under the night the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road and stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading&#13;
         boughs. In the dim light of the stars their stems were grey, and their quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Lothlórien!’ said Aragorn. ‘Glad I am to hear again the wind in the trees! We are still little more than five leagues from&#13;
         the Gates, but we can go no further. Here let us hope that the virtue of the Elves will keep us tonight from the peril that&#13;
         comes behind.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘If Elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world,’ said Gimli.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is long since any of my own folk journeyed hither back to the land whence we wandered in ages long ago,’ &#13;
         <a id="page440"/>said Legolas, ‘but we hear that Lórien is not yet deserted, for there is a secret power here that holds evil from the land.&#13;
         Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, and maybe they dwell now deep in the woods and far from the northern border.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,’ said Aragorn, and sighed as if some memory stirred in him. ‘We must fend for ourselves&#13;
         tonight. We will go forward a short way, until the trees are all about us, and then we will turn aside from the path and seek&#13;
         a place to rest in.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He stepped forward; but Boromir stood irresolute and did not follow. ‘Is there no other way?’ he said.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘What other fairer way would you desire?’ said Aragorn. ‘A plain road, though it led through a hedge of swords,’ said Boromir.&#13;
         ‘By strange paths has this Company been led, and so far to evil fortune. Against my will we passed under the shades of Moria,&#13;
         to our loss. And now we must enter the Golden Wood, you say. But of that perilous land we have heard in Gondor, and it is&#13;
         said that few come out who once go in; and of that few none have escaped unscathed.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Say not <em>unscathed</em>, but if you say <em>unchanged</em>, then maybe you will speak the truth,’ said Aragorn. ‘But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in the city of those who once&#13;
         were wise they now speak evil of Lothlórien. Believe what you will, there is no other way for us – unless you would go back&#13;
         to Moria-gate, or scale the pathless mountains, or swim the Great River all alone.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then lead on!’ said Boromir. ‘But it is perilous.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Perilous indeed,’ said Aragorn, ‘fair and perilous; but only evil need fear it, or those who bring some evil with them. Follow&#13;
         me!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They had gone little more than a mile into the forest when they came upon another stream flowing down swiftly from the tree-clad&#13;
         slopes that climbed back westward towards the mountains. They heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their&#13;
         right. Its dark hurrying waters ran across &#13;
         <a id="page441"/>the path before them, and joined the Silverlode in a swirl of dim pools among the roots of trees.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here is Nimrodel!’ said Legolas. ‘Of this stream the Silvan Elves made many songs long ago, and still we sing them in the&#13;
         North, remembering the rainbow on its falls, and the golden flowers that floated in its foam. All is dark now and the Bridge&#13;
         of Nimrodel is broken down. I will bathe my feet, for it is said that the water is healing to the weary.’ He went forward&#13;
         and climbed down the deep-cloven bank and stepped into the stream.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Follow me!’ he cried. ‘The water is not deep. Let us wade across! On the further bank we can rest, and the sound of the falling&#13;
         water may bring us sleep and forgetfulness of grief.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>One by one they climbed down and followed Legolas. For a moment Frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over his&#13;
         tired feet. It was cold but its touch was clean, and as he went on and it mounted to his knees, he felt that the stain of&#13;
         travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">When all the Company had crossed, they sat and rested and ate a little food; and Legolas told them tales of Lothlórien that&#13;
         the Elves of Mirkwood still kept in their hearts, of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by the Great River before the&#13;
         world was grey.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At length a silence fell, and they heard the music of the waterfall running sweetly in the shadows. Almost Frodo fancied that&#13;
         he could hear a voice singing, mingled with the sound of the water.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do you hear the voice of Nimrodel?’ asked Legolas. ‘I will sing you a song of the maiden Nimrodel, who bore the same name&#13;
         as the stream beside which she lived long ago. It is a fair song in our woodland tongue; but this is how it runs in the Westron&#13;
         Speech, as some in Rivendell now sing it.’ In a soft voice hardly to be heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he&#13;
         began:&#13;

      <p class="vext"><em>No tidings Elven-folk have heard</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext3"><em>Of Amroth evermore.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>The voice of Legolas faltered, and the song ceased. ‘I cannot sing any more,’ he said. ‘That is but a part, for I have forgotten&#13;
         much. It is long and sad, for it tells how sorrow came upon Lothlórien, Lórien of the Blossom, when the Dwarves awakened evil&#13;
         in the mountains.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But the Dwarves did not make the evil,’ said Gimli. ‘I said not so; yet evil came,’ answered Legolas sadly. ‘Then &#13;
         <a id="page444"/>many of the Elves of Nimrodel’s kindred left their dwellings and departed, and she was lost far in the South, in the passes&#13;
         of the White Mountains; and she came not to the ship where Amroth her lover waited for her. But in the spring when the wind&#13;
         is in the new leaves the echo of her voice may still be heard by the falls that bear her name. And when the wind is in the&#13;
         South the voice of Amroth comes up from the sea; for Nimrodel flows into Silverlode, that Elves call Celebrant, and Celebrant&#13;
         into Anduin the Great, and Anduin flows into the Bay of Belfalas whence the Elves of Lórien set sail. But neither Nimrodel&#13;
         nor Amroth came ever back.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that grew near the falls; for that was the custom of the&#13;
         Elves of Lórien, to dwell in the trees, and maybe it is so still. Therefore they were called the Galadhrim, the Tree-people.&#13;
         Deep in their forest the trees are very great. The people of the woods did not delve in the ground like Dwarves, nor build&#13;
         strong places of stone before the Shadow came.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And even in these latter days dwelling in the trees might be thought safer than sitting on the ground,’ said Gimli. He looked&#13;
         across the stream to the road that led back to Dimrill Dale, and then up into the roof of dark boughs above.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Your words bring good counsel, Gimli,’ said Aragorn. ‘We cannot build a house, but tonight we will do as the Galadhrim and&#13;
         seek refuge in the tree-tops, if we can. We have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Company now turned aside from the path, and went into the shadow of the deeper woods, westward along the mountain-stream&#13;
         away from Silverlode. Not far from the falls of Nimrodel they found a cluster of trees, some of which overhung the stream.&#13;
         Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but their height could not be guessed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will climb up,’ said Legolas. ‘I am at home among trees, by root or bough, though these trees are of a kind strange to&#13;
         me, save as a name in song. <em>Mellyrn</em> they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom, but I have never climbed &#13;
         <a id="page445"/>in one. I will see now what is their shape and way of growth.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Whatever it may be,’ said Pippin, ‘they will be marvellous trees indeed if they can offer any rest at night, except to birds.&#13;
         I cannot sleep on a perch!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then dig a hole in the ground,’ said Legolas, ‘if that is more after the fashion of your kind. But you must dig swift and&#13;
         deep, if you wish to hide from Orcs.’ He sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch that grew from the trunk high&#13;
         above his head. But even as he swung there for a moment, a voice spoke suddenly from the tree-shadows above him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>Daro!</em>’ it said in commanding tone, and Legolas dropped back to earth in surprise and fear. He shrank against the bole of the tree.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Stand still!’ he whispered to the others. ‘Do not move or speak!’</p>&#13;
      <p>There was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then another clear voice spoke in an elven-tongue. Frodo could understand&#13;
         little of what was said, for the speech that the Silvan folk east of the mountains used among themselves was unlike that of&#13;
         the West. Legolas looked up and answered in the same language.&#13;
         <sup>&#13;
            <a href="Fellowshipofth_foot-1.html#footnote_number_9">*</a>&#13;
         </sup>&#13;
         <a id="footnote_reference_9"/>&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Who are they, and what do they say?’ asked Merry.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘They’re Elves,’ said Sam. ‘Can’t you hear their voices?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, they are Elves,’ said Legolas; ‘and they say that you breathe so loud that they could shoot you in the dark.’ Sam hastily&#13;
         put his hand over his mouth. ‘But they say also that you need have no fear. They have been aware of us for a long while. They&#13;
         heard my voice across the Nimrodel, and knew that I was one of their Northern kindred, and therefore they did not hinder our&#13;
         crossing; and afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me climb up with Frodo; for they seem to have had some tidings of&#13;
         him and of our journey. The others they ask to wait a little, and to keep watch at the foot of the tree, until they have decided&#13;
         what is to be done.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page446"/>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Out of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope, silver-grey and glimmering in the dark, and though it looked&#13;
         slender it proved strong enough to bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, and Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying&#13;
         not to breathe loudly. The branches of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept upward; but&#13;
         near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs, and among these they found that there had been built a wooden&#13;
         platform, or <em>flet</em> as such things were called in those days: the Elves called it a <em>talan</em>. It was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder passed.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated with three other Elves. They were clad in shadowy-grey,&#13;
         and could not be seen among the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, and one of them uncovered a small lamp&#13;
         that gave out a slender silver beam. He held it up, looking at Frodo’s face, and Sam’s. Then he shut off the light again,&#13;
         and spoke words of welcome in his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in return.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Welcome!’ the Elf then said again in the Common Language, speaking slowly. ‘We seldom use any tongue but our own; for we&#13;
         dwell now in the heart of the forest, and do not willingly have dealings with any other folk. Even our own kindred in the&#13;
         North are sundered from us. But there are some of us still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our&#13;
         enemies, and they speak the languages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my name. My brothers, Rúmil and Orophin, speak little&#13;
         of your tongue.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But we have heard rumours of your coming, for the messengers of Elrond passed by Lórien on their way home up the Dimrill&#13;
         Stair. We had not heard of – hobbits, of halflings, for many a long year, and did not know that any yet dwelt in Middle-earth.&#13;
         You do not look evil! And since you come with an Elf of our kindred, we are willing to befriend you, as Elrond asked; though&#13;
         it is not our custom to lead strangers through our land. But you must stay here tonight. How many are you?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page447"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Eight,’ said Legolas. ‘Myself, four hobbits; and two men, one of whom, Aragorn, is an Elf-friend of the folk of Westernesse.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lórien,’ said Haldir, ‘and he has the favour of the Lady. All then is well.&#13;
         But you have yet spoken only of seven.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The eighth is a dwarf,’ said Legolas.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘A dwarf!’ said Haldir. ‘That is not well. We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days. They are not permitted&#13;
         in our land. I cannot allow him to pass.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But he is from the Lonely Mountain, one of Dáin’s trusty people, and friendly to Elrond,’ said Frodo. ‘Elrond himself chose&#13;
         him to be one of our companions, and he has been brave and faithful.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Elves spoke together in soft voices, and questioned Legolas in their own tongue. ‘Very good,’ said Haldir at last. ‘We&#13;
         will do this, though it is against our liking. If Aragorn and Legolas will guard him, and answer for him, he shall pass; but&#13;
         he must go blindfold through Lothlórien.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But now we must debate no longer. Your folk must not remain on the ground. We have been keeping watch on the rivers, ever&#13;
         since we saw a great troop of Orcs going north towards Moria, along the skirts of the mountains, many days ago. Wolves are&#13;
         howling on the wood’s borders. If you have indeed come from Moria, the peril cannot be far behind. Tomorrow early you must&#13;
         go on.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us – we do not fear them! There is another <em>talan</em> in the next tree. There the others must take refuge. You, Legolas, must answer to us for them. Call us, if anything is amiss!&#13;
         And have an eye on that dwarf!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Legolas at once went down the ladder to take Haldir’s message; and soon afterwards Merry and Pippin clambered up on to the&#13;
         high flet. They were out of breath and seemed rather scared.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There!’ said Merry panting. ‘We have lugged up your &#13;
         <a id="page448"/>blankets as well as our own. Strider has hidden all the rest of our baggage in a deep drift of leaves.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You had no need of your burdens,’ said Haldir. ‘It is cold in the tree-tops in winter, though the wind tonight is in the&#13;
         South; but we have food and drink to give you that will drive away the night-chill, and we have skins and cloaks to spare.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The hobbits accepted this second (and far better) supper very gladly. Then they wrapped themselves warmly, not only in the&#13;
         fur-cloaks of the Elves, but in their own blankets as well, and tried to go to sleep. But weary as they were only Sam found&#13;
         that easy to do. Hobbits do not like heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet was not&#13;
         at all to their liking as a bedroom. It had no walls, not even a rail; only on one side was there a light plaited screen,&#13;
         which could be moved and fixed in different places according to the wind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Pippin went on talking for a while. ‘I hope, if I do go to sleep in this bird-loft, that I shan’t roll off,’ he said.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Once I do get to sleep,’ said Sam, ‘I shall go on sleeping, whether I roll off or no. And the less said, the sooner I’ll&#13;
         drop off, if you take my meaning.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Frodo lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering leaves. Sam was snoring&#13;
         at his side long before he himself closed his eyes. He could dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting motionless with&#13;
         their arms about their knees, speaking in whispers. The other had gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower branches.&#13;
         At last lulled by the wind in the boughs above, and the sweet murmur of the falls of Nimrodel below, Frodo fell asleep with&#13;
         the song of Legolas running in his mind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Late in the night he woke. The other hobbits were asleep. The Elves were gone. The sickle Moon was gleaming dimly among the&#13;
         leaves. The wind was still. A little way off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground below. There&#13;
         was a ring of metal. The sounds died slowly away, and seemed to go southward, on into the wood.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page449"/>&#13;
      <p>A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. Frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grey-hooded Elf. He looked&#13;
         towards the hobbits.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What is it?’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>Yrch!</em>’ said the Elf in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the rope-ladder rolled up.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Orcs!’ said Frodo. ‘What are they doing?’ But the Elf had gone.</p>&#13;
      <p>There were no more sounds. Even the leaves were silent, and the very falls seemed to be hushed. Frodo sat and shivered in&#13;
         his wraps. He was thankful that they had not been caught on the ground; but he felt that the trees offered little protection,&#13;
         except concealment. Orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent, it was said, but they could also climb. He drew out Sting: it&#13;
         flashed and glittered like a blue flame; and then slowly faded again and grew dull. In spite of the fading of his sword the&#13;
         feeling of immediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and crawled to the opening and peered&#13;
         down. He was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at the tree’s foot far below.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Not Elves; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their movements. Then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing;&#13;
         and something seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree-trunk. He stared down into the dark, holding his breath.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Something was now climbing slowly, and its breath came like a soft hissing through closed teeth. Then coming up, close to&#13;
         the stem, Frodo saw two pale eyes. They stopped and gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly they turned away, and a shadowy figure&#13;
         slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Immediately afterwards Haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches. ‘There was something in this tree that I have&#13;
         never seen before,’ he said. ‘It was not an orc. It fled as soon as I touched the tree-stem. It seemed to be wary, and to&#13;
         have some skill in trees, or I might have thought that it was one of you hobbits.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page450"/>&#13;
      <p>‘I did not shoot, for I dared not arouse any cries: we cannot risk battle. A strong company of Orcs has passed. They crossed&#13;
         the Nimrodel – curse their foul feet in its clean water! – and went on down the old road beside the river. They seemed to&#13;
         pick up some scent, and they searched the ground for a while near the place where you halted. The three of us could not challenge&#13;
         a hundred, so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices, leading them on into the wood.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people. None of the Orcs will ever return out of Lórien.&#13;
         And there will be many Elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls. But you must take the road south as&#13;
         soon as it is fully light.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Day came pale from the East. As the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves of the mallorn, and it seemed to the&#13;
         hobbits that the early sun of a cool summer’s morning was shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among the moving branches. Looking&#13;
         through an opening on the south side of the flet Frodo saw all the valley of the Silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold&#13;
         tossing gently in the breeze.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The morning was still young and cold when the Company set out again, guided now by Haldir and his brother Rúmil. ‘Farewell,&#13;
         sweet Nimrodel!’ cried Legolas. Frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree-stems. ‘Farewell,’&#13;
         he said. It seemed to him that he would never hear again a running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable notes&#13;
         in an endless changeful music.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the Silverlode, and for some way they followed it southward.&#13;
         There were the prints of orc-feet in the earth. But soon Haldir turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the&#13;
         river under their shadows.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is one of my people yonder across the stream,’ he said, ‘though you may not see him.’ He gave a call like the low whistle&#13;
         of a bird, and out of a thicket of young trees an Elf stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood thrown back; his &#13;
         <a id="page451"/>hair glinted like gold in the morning sun. Haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and&#13;
         bound the end about a tree near the bank.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,’ said Haldir, ‘and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold.&#13;
         We do not set foot in it so far north, unless we must. But in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges. This is how&#13;
         we cross! Follow me!’ He made his end of the rope fast about another tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the river and&#13;
         back again, as if he were on a road.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I can walk this path,’ said Legolas; ‘but the others have not this skill. Must they swim?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No!’ said Haldir. ‘We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above the other, one shoulder-high, and another half-high,&#13;
         and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with care.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When this slender bridge had been made, the Company passed over, some cautiously and slowly, others more easily. Of the hobbits&#13;
         Pippin proved the best for he was sure-footed, and he walked over quickly, holding only with one hand; but he kept his eyes&#13;
         on the bank ahead and did not look down. Sam shuffled along, clutching hard, and looking down into the pale eddying water&#13;
         as if it was a chasm in the mountains.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He breathed with relief when he was safely across. ‘Live and learn! as my gaffer used to say. Though he was thinking of gardening,&#13;
         not of roosting like a bird, nor of trying to walk like a spider. Not even my uncle Andy ever did a trick like that!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When at length all the Company was gathered on the east bank of the Silverlode, the Elves untied the ropes and coiled two&#13;
         of them. Rúmil, who had remained on the other side, drew back the last one, slung it on his shoulder, and with a wave of his&#13;
         hand went away, back to Nimrodel to keep watch.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now, friends,’ said Haldir, ‘you have entered the Naith of Lórien, or the Gore, as you would say, for it is the land that&#13;
         lies like a spearhead between the arms of Silverlode and Anduin the Great. We allow no strangers to spy out the &#13;
         <a id="page452"/>secrets of the Naith. Few indeed are permitted even to set foot there.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘As was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of Gimli the Dwarf. The others may walk free for a while, until we come nearer&#13;
         to our dwellings, down in Egladil, in the Angle between the waters.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>This was not at all to the liking of Gimli. ‘The agreement was made without my consent,’ he said. ‘I will not walk blindfold,&#13;
         like a beggar or a prisoner. And I am no spy. My folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the Enemy. Neither&#13;
         have we done harm to the Elves. I am no more likely to betray you than Legolas, or any other of my companions.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not doubt you,’ said Haldir. ‘Yet this is our law. I am not the master of the law, and cannot set it aside. I have done&#13;
         much in letting you set foot over Celebrant.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gimli was obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his hand upon the haft of his axe. ‘I will go forward free,’&#13;
         he said, ‘or I will go back and seek my own land, where I am known to be true of word, though I perish alone in the wilderness.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You cannot go back,’ said Haldir sternly. ‘Now you have come thus far, you must be brought before the Lord and the Lady.&#13;
         They shall judge you, to hold you or to give you leave, as they will. You cannot cross the rivers again, and behind you there&#13;
         are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass. You would be slain before you saw them.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gimli drew his axe from his belt. Haldir and his companion bent their bows. ‘A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks!’ said&#13;
         Legolas.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come!’ said Aragorn. ‘If I am still to lead this Company, you must do as I bid. It is hard upon the Dwarf to be thus singled&#13;
         out. We will all be blindfold, even Legolas. That will be best, though it will make the journey slow and dull.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Gimli laughed suddenly. ‘A merry troop of fools we shall look! Will Haldir lead us all on a string, like many blind beggars&#13;
         with one dog? But I will be content, if only Legolas here shares my blindness.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page453"/>&#13;
      <p>‘I am an Elf and a kinsman here,’ said Legolas, becoming angry in his turn.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now let us cry: “a plague on the stiff necks of Elves!” ’ said Aragorn. ‘But the Company shall all fare alike. Come, bind&#13;
         our eyes, Haldir!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do not lead us well,’ said Gimli as they bound a cloth about&#13;
         his eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You will have no claim,’ said Haldir. ‘I shall lead you well, and the paths are smooth and straight.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Alas for the folly of these days!’ said Legolas. ‘Here all are enemies of the one Enemy, and yet I must walk blind, while&#13;
         the sun is merry in the woodland under leaves of gold!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Folly it may seem,’ said Haldir. ‘Indeed in nothing is the power of the Dark Lord more clearly shown than in the estrangement&#13;
         that divides all those who still oppose him. Yet so little faith and trust do we find now in the world beyond Lothlórien,&#13;
         unless maybe in Rivendell, that we dare not by our own trust endanger our land. We live now upon an island amid many perils,&#13;
         and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The rivers long defended us, but they are a sure guard no more; for the Shadow has crept northward all about us. Some speak&#13;
         of departing, yet for that it already seems too late. The mountains to the west are growing evil; to the east the lands are&#13;
         waste, and full of Sauron’s creatures; and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass southward through Rohan, and the&#13;
         mouths of the Great River are watched by the Enemy. Even if we could come to the shores of the Sea, we should find no longer&#13;
         any shelter there. It is said that there are still havens of the High Elves, but they are far north and west, beyond the land&#13;
         of the Halflings. But where that may be, though the Lord and Lady may know, I do not.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You ought at least to guess, since you have seen us,’ said Merry. ‘There are Elf-havens west of my land, the Shire, where&#13;
         Hobbits live.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the &#13;
         <a id="page454"/>sea!’ said Haldir. ‘It is long indeed since any of my folk have looked on it, yet still we remember it in song. Tell me of&#13;
         these havens as we walk.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I cannot,’ said Merry. ‘I have never seen them. I have never been out of my own land before. And if I had known what the&#13;
         world outside was like, I don’t think I should have had the heart to leave it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not even to see fair Lothlórien?’ said Haldir. ‘The world is indeed full of peril, and in it there are many dark places;&#13;
         but still there is much that is fair, and though in all lands love is now mingled with grief, it grows perhaps the greater.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Some there are among us who sing that the Shadow will draw back, and peace shall come again. Yet I do not believe that the&#13;
         world about us will ever again be as it was of old, or the light of the Sun as it was aforetime. For the Elves, I fear, it&#13;
         will prove at best a truce, in which they may pass to the Sea unhindered and leave the Middle-earth for ever. Alas for Lothlórien&#13;
         that I love! It would be a poor life in a land where no mallorn grew. But if there are mallorn-trees beyond the Great Sea,&#13;
         none have reported it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As they spoke thus, the Company filed slowly along the paths in the wood, led by Haldir, while the other Elf walked behind.&#13;
         They felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft, and after a while they walked more freely, without fear of hurt or&#13;
         fall. Being deprived of sight, Frodo found his hearing and other senses sharpened. He could smell the trees and the trodden&#13;
         grass. He could hear many different notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead, the river murmuring away on his right, and&#13;
         the thin clear voices of birds high in the sky. He felt the sun upon his face and hands when they passed through an open glade.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of Silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him, and it deepened as he walked on&#13;
         into the Naith: it seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge of time into a corner of the Elder Days, and was now walking&#13;
         in a world that was no more. In Rivendell there was memory of ancient things; in Lórien the &#13;
         <a id="page455"/>ancient things still lived on in the waking world. Evil had been seen and heard there, sorrow had been known; the Elves feared&#13;
         and distrusted the world outside: wolves were howling on the wood’s borders: but on the land of Lórien no shadow lay.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">All that day the Company marched on, until they felt the cool evening come and heard the early night-wind whispering among&#13;
         many leaves. Then they rested and slept without fear upon the ground; for their guides would not permit them to unbind their&#13;
         eyes, and they could not climb. In the morning they went on again, walking without haste. At noon they halted, and Frodo was&#13;
         aware that they had passed out under the shining Sun. Suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>A marching host of Elves had come up silently: they were hastening towards the northern borders to guard against any attack&#13;
         from Moria; and they brought news, some of which Haldir reported. The marauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed;&#13;
         the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains, and were being pursued. A strange creature also had been seen, running&#13;
         with bent back and with hands near the ground, like a beast and yet not of beast-shape. It had eluded capture, and they had&#13;
         not shot it, not knowing whether it was good or ill, and it had vanished down the Silverlode southward.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Also,’ said Haldir, ‘they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim. You are all to walk free, even the&#13;
         dwarf Gimli. It seems that the Lady knows who and what is each member of your Company. New messages have come from Rivendell&#13;
         perhaps.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He removed the bandage first from Gimli’s eyes. ‘Your pardon!’ he said, bowing low. ‘Look on us now with friendly eyes! Look&#13;
         and be glad, for you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the Naith of Lórien since Durin’s Day!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When his eyes were in turn uncovered, Frodo looked up and caught his breath. They were standing in an open space.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page456"/>&#13;
      <p>To the left stood a great mound, covered with a sward of grass as green as Springtime in the Elder Days. Upon it, as a double&#13;
         crown, grew two circles of trees: the outer had bark of snowy white, and were leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness;&#13;
         the inner were mallorn-trees of great height, still arrayed in pale gold. High amid the branches of a towering tree that stood&#13;
         in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of the trees, and all about the green hillsides the grass was&#13;
         studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars. Among them, nodding on slender stalks, were other flowers, white and&#13;
         palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass. Over all the sky was blue, and the sun of afternoon&#13;
         glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,’ said Haldir. ‘For this is the heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago, and here&#13;
         is the mound of Amroth, where in happier days his high house was built. Here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading&#13;
         grass: the yellow <em>elanor</em>, and the pale <em>niphredil</em>. Here we will stay awhile, and come to the city of the Galadhrim at dusk.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but Frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder. It seemed to him that&#13;
         he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it for which his language had no name.&#13;
         All that he saw was shapely, but the shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the&#13;
         uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and&#13;
         blue and green, but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made for them names&#13;
         new and wonderful. In winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring. No blemish or sickness or deformity could&#13;
         be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of Lórien there was no stain.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page457"/>&#13;
      <p>He turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round with a puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as if&#13;
         he was not sure that he was awake. ‘It’s sunlight and bright day, right enough,’ he said. ‘I thought that Elves were all for&#13;
         moon and stars: but this is more Elvish than anything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was <em>inside</em> a song, if you take my meaning.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both thought and word. He smiled. ‘You feel the power of&#13;
         the Lady of the Galadhrim,’ he said. ‘Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes. Though he walked and breathed, and about him living leaves&#13;
         and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that he was in a timeless land that did not&#13;
         fade or change or fall into forgetfulness. When he had gone and passed again into the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer&#13;
         from the Shire would walk there, upon the grass among <em>elanor</em> and <em>niphredil</em> in fair Lothlórien.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth and sighed among the branches.&#13;
         Frodo stood still, hearing far off great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away, and sea-birds crying whose&#13;
         race had perished from the earth.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet. As Frodo prepared to follow him, he laid his hand upon the tree&#13;
         beside the ladder: never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a tree’s skin and of&#13;
         the life within it. He felt a delight in wood and the touch of it, neither as forester nor as carpenter; it was the delight&#13;
         of the living tree itself.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, Haldir took his hand and turned him towards the South. ‘Look this way first!’&#13;
         he said.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could&#13;
         not tell. Out of it, it seemed to him that the power and light &#13;
         <a id="page458"/>came that held all the land in sway. He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city. Then he looked eastward&#13;
         and saw all the land of Lórien running down to the pale gleam of Anduin, the Great River. He lifted his eyes across the river&#13;
         and all the light went out, and he was back again in the world he knew. Beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty,&#13;
         formless and vague, until far away it rose again like a wall, dark and drear. The sun that lay on Lothlórien had no power&#13;
         to enlighten the shadow of that distant height.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood,’ said Haldir. ‘It is clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one&#13;
         against another and their branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol Guldur, where long the hidden&#13;
         Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is inhabited again, and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it&#13;
         of late. In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one to another; and ever they strive now in thought,&#13;
         but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been discovered. Not yet.’ He turned&#13;
         and climbed swiftly down, and they followed him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At the hill’s foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as a tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of <em>elanor</em>, and a light was in his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things&#13;
         as they once had been in this same place. For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed&#13;
         in white, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see. <em>Arwen vanimelda, namárië!</em> he said, and then he drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and smiled.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,’ he said, ‘and here my heart dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond the dark&#13;
         roads that we still must tread, you and I. Come with me!’ And taking Frodo’s hand in his, he left the hill of Cerin Amroth&#13;
         and came there never again as living man.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-19">THE MIRROR OF GALADRIEL</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">The sun was sinking behind the mountains, and the shadows were deepening in the woods, when they went on again. Their paths&#13;
         now went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered. Night came beneath the trees as they walked, and the Elves uncovered&#13;
         their silver lamps.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars. There&#13;
         was a wide treeless space before them, running in a great circle and bending away on either hand. Beyond it was a deep fosse&#13;
         lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its brink was green, as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone. Upon&#13;
         the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than&#13;
         any they had yet seen in all the land. Their height could not be guessed, but they stood up in the twilight like living towers.&#13;
         In their many-tiered branches and amid their ever-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green and gold and silver.&#13;
         Haldir turned towards the Company.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Welcome to Caras Galadhon!’ he said. ‘Here is the city of the Galadhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady&#13;
         of Lórien. But we cannot enter here, for the gates do not look northward. We must go round to the southern side, and the way&#13;
         is not short, for the city is great.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">There was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of the fosse. Along this they went westward, with the city&#13;
         ever climbing up like a green cloud upon their left; and as the night deepened more lights sprang forth, until all the hill&#13;
         seemed afire with stars. They came at last to a white &#13;
         <a id="page460"/>bridge, and crossing found the great gates of the city: they faced south-west, set between the ends of the encircling wall&#13;
         that here overlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung with many lamps.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Haldir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened soundlessly; but of guards Frodo could see no sign. The travellers passed&#13;
         within, and the gates shut behind them. They were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall, and passing quickly through&#13;
         it they entered the City of the Trees. No folk could they see, nor hear any feet upon the paths; but there were many voices,&#13;
         about them, and in the air above. Far away up on the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from on high like soft&#13;
         rain upon leaves.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They went along many paths and climbed many stairs, until they came to the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn&#13;
         a fountain shimmering. It was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees, and it fell into a basin of silver,&#13;
         from which a white stream spilled. Upon the south side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great smooth&#13;
         bole gleamed like grey silk, and up it towered, until its first branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy&#13;
         clouds of leaves. Beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were seated. They sprang up as the travellers&#13;
         approached, and Frodo saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white cloaks.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel,’ said Haldir. ‘It is their wish that you should ascend and speak with them.’</p>&#13;
      <p>One of the Elf-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn, and it was answered three times from far above. ‘I will go&#13;
         first,’ said Haldir. ‘Let Frodo come next and with him Legolas. The others may follow as they wish. It is a long climb for&#13;
         those that are not accustomed to such stairs, but you may rest upon the way.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some on another, and some set about the bole &#13;
         <a id="page461"/>of the tree, so that the ladder passed through them. At a great height above the ground he came to a wide <em>talan</em>, like the deck of a great ship. On it was built a house, so large that almost it would have served for a hall of Men upon&#13;
         the earth. He entered behind Haldir, and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape, in the midst of which grew the trunk&#13;
         of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and silver and its roof of gold. Many Elves were seated there.&#13;
         On two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side by side, Celeborn and Galadriel.&#13;
         They stood up to greet their guests, after the manner of Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall they&#13;
         were, and the Lady no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave and beautiful. They were clad wholly in white; and the&#13;
         hair of the Lady was of deep gold, and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright; but no sign of age was&#13;
         upon them, unless it were in the depths of their eyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the&#13;
         wells of deep memory.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Haldir led Frodo before them, and the Lord welcomed him in his own tongue. The Lady Galadriel said no word but looked long&#13;
         upon his face.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Sit now beside my chair, Frodo of the Shire!’ said Celeborn. ‘When all have come we will speak together.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered. ‘Welcome Aragorn son of Arathorn!’ he said. ‘It is&#13;
         eight and thirty years of the world outside since you came to this land; and those years lie heavy on you. But the end is&#13;
         near, for good or ill. Here lay aside your burden for a while!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Welcome son of Thranduil! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the North.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Welcome Gimli son of Glóin! It is long indeed since we saw one of Durin’s folk in Caras Galadhon. But today we have broken&#13;
         our long law. May it be a sign that though the &#13;
         <a id="page462"/>world is now dark better days are at hand, and that friendship shall be renewed between our peoples.’ Gimli bowed low.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">When all the guests were seated before his chair the Lord looked at them again. ‘Here there are eight,’ he said. ‘Nine were&#13;
         to set out: so said the messages. But maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have not heard. Elrond is far away,&#13;
         and darkness gathers between us, and all this year the shadows have grown longer.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Nay, there was no change of counsel,’ said the Lady Galadriel, speaking for the first time. Her voice was clear and musical,&#13;
         but deeper than woman’s wont. ‘Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the borders of this land. Now&#13;
         tell us where he is; for I much desired to speak with him again. But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the&#13;
         fences of Lothlórien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden from me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Alas!’ said Aragorn. ‘Gandalf the Grey fell into shadow. He remained in Moria and did not escape.’</p>&#13;
      <p>At these words all the Elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and amazement. ‘These are evil tidings,’ said Celeborn, ‘the&#13;
         most evil that have been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds.’ He turned to Haldir. ‘Why has nothing of this&#13;
         been told to me before?’ he asked in the elven-tongue.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We have not spoken to Haldir of our deeds or our purpose,’ said Legolas. ‘At first we were weary and danger was too close&#13;
         behind; and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we walked in gladness on the fair paths of Lórien.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended,’ said Frodo. ‘Gandalf was our guide, and he led us through Moria; and&#13;
         when our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us, and he fell.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Tell us now the full tale!’ said Celeborn.</p>&#13;
      <p>Then Aragorn recounted all that had happened upon the pass of Caradhras, and in the days that followed; and he &#13;
         <a id="page463"/>spoke of Balin and his book, and the fight in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and the fire, and the narrow bridge, and the coming&#13;
         of the Terror. ‘An evil of the Ancient World it seemed, such as I have never seen before,’ said Aragorn. ‘It was both a shadow&#13;
         and a flame, strong and terrible.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was a Balrog of Morgoth,’ said Legolas; ‘of all elf-banes the most deadly, save the One who sits in the Dark Tower.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Indeed I saw upon the bridge that which haunts our darkest dreams, I saw Durin’s Bane,’ said Gimli in a low voice, and dread&#13;
         was in his eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Alas!’ said Celeborn. ‘We long have feared that under Caradhras a terror slept. But had I known that the Dwarves had stirred&#13;
         up this evil in Moria again, I would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders, you and all that went with you. And&#13;
         if it were possible, one would say that at the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net of&#13;
         Moria.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He would be rash indeed that said that thing,’ said Galadriel gravely. ‘Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.&#13;
         Those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose. But however it may be with the guide, the followers&#13;
         are blameless. Do not repent of your welcome to the Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long and far from Lothlórien, who of&#13;
         the Galadhrim, even Celeborn the Wise, would pass nigh and would not wish to look upon their ancient home, though it had become&#13;
         an abode of dragons?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Dark is the water of Kheled-zâram, and cold are the springs of Kibil-nâla, and fair were the many-pillared halls of Khazad-dûm&#13;
         in Elder Days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone.’ She looked upon Gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she&#13;
         smiled. And the Dwarf, hearing the names given in his own ancient tongue, looked up and met her eyes; and it seemed to him&#13;
         that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding. Wonder came into his face, and then&#13;
         he smiled in answer.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: ‘Yet &#13;
         <a id="page464"/>more fair is the living land of Lórien, and the Lady Galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the earth!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">There was a silence. At length Celeborn spoke again. ‘I did not know that your plight was so evil,’ he said. ‘Let Gimli forget&#13;
         my harsh words: I spoke in the trouble of my heart. I will do what I can to aid you, each according to his wish and need,&#13;
         but especially that one of the little folk who bears the burden.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Your quest is known to us,’ said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. ‘But we will not here speak of it more openly. Yet not in vain&#13;
         will it prove, maybe, that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed. For the Lord of the Galadhrim&#13;
         is accounted the wisest of the Elves of Middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt in the&#13;
         West since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years uncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed&#13;
         over the mountains, and together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I it was who first summoned the White Council. And if my designs had not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf&#13;
         the Grey, and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I will not give you counsel,&#13;
         saying do this, or do that. For not in doing or contriving, nor in choosing between this course and another, can I avail;&#13;
         but only in knowing what was and is, and in part also what shall be. But this I will say to you: your Quest stands upon the&#13;
         edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all. Yet hope remains while all the Company is true.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>And with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked searchingly at each of them in turn. None save Legolas&#13;
         and Aragorn could long endure her glance. Sam quickly blushed and hung his head.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At length the Lady Galadriel released them from her eyes, and she smiled. ‘Do not let your hearts be troubled,’ she said.&#13;
         ‘Tonight you shall sleep in peace.’ Then they sighed and felt &#13;
         <a id="page465"/>suddenly weary, as those who have been questioned long and deeply, though no words had been spoken openly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Go now!’ said Celeborn. ‘You are worn with sorrow and much toil. Even if your Quest did not concern us closely, you should&#13;
         have refuge in this City, until you were healed and refreshed. Now you shall rest, and we will not speak of your further road&#13;
         for a while.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">That night the Company slept upon the ground, much to the satisfaction of the hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion&#13;
         among the trees near the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace with fair Elvish voices&#13;
         they left them. For a little while the travellers talked of their night before in the tree-tops, and of their day’s journey,&#13;
         and of the Lord and Lady; for they had not yet the heart to look further back.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What did you blush for, Sam?’ said Pippin. ‘You soon broke down. Anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience. I&#13;
         hope it was nothing worse than a wicked plot to steal one of my blankets.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I never thought no such thing,’ answered Sam, in no mood for jest. ‘If you want to know, I felt as if I hadn’t got nothing&#13;
         on, and I didn’t like it. She seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what I would do if she gave me the chance of flying&#13;
         back home to the Shire to a nice little hole with – with a bit of garden of my own.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That’s funny,’ said Merry. ‘Almost exactly what I felt myself; only, only well, I don’t think I’ll say any more,’ he ended&#13;
         lamely.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>All of them, it seemed, had fared alike: each had felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow full of fear that lay&#13;
         ahead, and something that he greatly desired: clear before his mind it lay, and to get it he had only to turn aside from the&#13;
         road and leave the Quest and the war against Sauron to others.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And it seemed to me, too,’ said Gimli, ‘that my choice would remain secret and known only to myself.’</p>&#13;
      <a id="page466"/>&#13;
      <p>‘To me it seemed exceedingly strange,’ said Boromir. ‘Maybe it was only a test, and she thought to read our thoughts for her&#13;
         own good purpose; but almost I should have said that she was tempting us, and offering what she pretended to have the power&#13;
         to give. It need not be said that I refused to listen. The Men of Minas Tirith are true to their word.’ But what he thought&#13;
         that the Lady had offered him Boromir did not tell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>And as for Frodo, he would not speak, though Boromir pressed him with questions. ‘She held you long in her gaze, Ring-bearer,’&#13;
         he said.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Frodo; ‘but whatever came into my mind then I will keep there.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, have a care!’ said Boromir. ‘I do not feel too sure of this Elvish Lady and her purposes.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Speak no evil of the Lady Galadriel!’ said Aragorn sternly. ‘You know not what you say. There is in her and in this land&#13;
         no evil, unless a man bring it hither himself. Then let him beware! But tonight I shall sleep without fear for the first time&#13;
         since I left Rivendell. And may I sleep deep, and forget for a while my grief! I am weary in body and in heart.’ He cast&#13;
         himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The others soon did the same, and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber. When they woke they found that the light of day&#13;
         was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion, and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They remained some days in Lothlórien, so far as they could tell or remember. All the while that they dwelt there the sun&#13;
         shone clear, save for a gentle rain that fell at times, and passed away leaving all things fresh and clean. The air was cool&#13;
         and soft, as if it were early spring, yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winter. It seemed to them&#13;
         that they did little but eat and drink and rest, and walk among the trees; and it was enough.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They had not seen the Lord and Lady again, and they had &#13;
         <a id="page467"/>little speech with the Elven-folk; for few of these knew or would use the Westron tongue. Haldir had bidden them farewell&#13;
         and gone back again to the fences of the North, where great watch was now kept since the tidings of Moria that the Company&#13;
         had brought. Legolas was away much among the Galadhrim, and after the first night he did not sleep with the other companions,&#13;
         though he returned to eat and talk with them. Often he took Gimli with him when he went abroad in the land, and the others&#13;
         wondered at this change.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of Gandalf, and all that each had known and seen of him came clear&#13;
         before their minds. As they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew more keen. Often they heard&#13;
         nearby Elvish voices singing, and knew that they were making songs of lamentation for his fall, for they caught his name among&#13;
         the sweet sad words that they could not understand.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p><em>Mithrandir</em>, <em>Mithrandir</em> sang the Elves, <em>O Pilgrim Grey!</em> For so they loved to call him. But if Legolas was with the Company, he would not interpret the songs for them, saying that&#13;
         he had not the skill, and that for him the grief was still too near, a matter for tears and not yet for song.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was Frodo who first put something of his sorrow into halting words. He was seldom moved to make song or rhyme; even in&#13;
         Rivendell he had listened and had not sung himself, though his memory was stored with many things that others had made before&#13;
         him. But now as he sat beside the fountain in Lórien and heard about him the voices of the Elves, his thought took shape in&#13;
         a song that seemed fair to him; yet when he tried to repeat it to Sam only snatches remained, faded as a handful of withered&#13;
         leaves.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>When evening in the Shire was grey</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>his footsteps on the Hill were heard;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>before the dawn he went away</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>on journey long without a word.</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page468"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>From Wilderland to Western shore,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>from northern waste to southern hill,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>through dragon-lair and hidden door</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>and darkling woods he walked at will.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>With Dwarf and Hobbit, Elves and Men,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>with mortal and immortal folk,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>with bird on bough and beast in den,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>in their own secret tongues he spoke.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>A deadly sword, a healing hand,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>a back that bent beneath its load;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>a trumpet-voice, a burning brand,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>a weary pilgrim on the road.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>A lord of wisdom throned he sat,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>swift in anger, quick to laugh;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>an old man in a battered hat</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>who leaned upon a thorny staff.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>He stood upon the bridge alone</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>and Fire and Shadow both defied;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>his staff was broken on the stone,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>in Khazad-dûm his wisdom died.</em></p>&#13;
      <p>‘Why, you’ll be beating Mr. Bilbo next!’ said Sam.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, I am afraid not,’ said Frodo. ‘But that is the best I can do yet.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, Mr. Frodo, if you do have another go, I hope you’ll say a word about his fireworks,’ said Sam. ‘Something like this:</p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>The finest rockets ever seen:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>they burst in stars of blue and green,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>or after thunder golden showers</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>came falling like a rain of flowers.</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page469"/>&#13;
      <p class="p1">Though that doesn’t do them justice by a long road.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, I’ll leave that to you, Sam. Or perhaps to Bilbo. But – well, I can’t talk of it any more. I can’t bear to think of bringing&#13;
         the news to him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">One evening Frodo and Sam were walking together in the cool twilight. Both of them felt restless again. On Frodo suddenly&#13;
         the shadow of parting had fallen: he knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave Lothlórien.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you think of Elves now, Sam?’ he said. ‘I asked you the same question once before – it seems a very long while ago;&#13;
         but you have seen more of them since then.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have indeed!’ said Sam. ‘And I reckon there’s Elves and Elves. They’re all Elvish enough, but they’re not all the same.&#13;
         Now these folk aren’t wanderers or homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us: they seem to belong here, more even&#13;
         than Hobbits do in the Shire. Whether they’ve made the land, or the land’s made them, it’s hard to say, if you take my meaning.&#13;
         It’s wonderfully quiet here. Nothing seems to be going on, and nobody seems to want it to. If there’s any magic about, it’s&#13;
         right down deep, where I can’t lay my hands on it, in a manner of speaking.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You can see and feel it everywhere,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well,’ said Sam, ‘you can’t see nobody working it. No fireworks like poor old Gandalf used to show. I wonder we don’t see&#13;
         nothing of the Lord and Lady in all these days. I fancy now that <em>she</em> could do some wonderful things, if she had a mind. I’d dearly love to see some Elf-magic, Mr. Frodo!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wouldn’t,’ said Frodo. ‘I am content. And I don’t miss Gandalf ’s fireworks, but his bushy eyebrows, and his quick temper,&#13;
         and his voice.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You’re right,’ said Sam. ‘And don’t think I’m finding fault. I’ve often wanted to see a bit of magic like what it tells of&#13;
         in old tales, but I’ve never heard of a better land than this. It’s like being at home and on a holiday at the same time,&#13;
         if you understand me. I don’t want to leave. All the same, I’m &#13;
         <a id="page470"/>beginning to feel that if we’ve got to go on, then we’d best get it over.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>It’s the job that’s never started as takes longest to finish</em>, as my old gaffer used to say. And I don’t reckon that these folk can do much more to help us, magic or no. It’s when we&#13;
         leave this land that we shall miss Gandalf worse, I’m thinking.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am afraid that’s only too true, Sam,’ said Frodo. ‘Yet I hope very much that before we leave we shall see the Lady of the&#13;
         Elves again.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Even as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer to their words, the Lady Galadriel approaching. Tall and white and fair&#13;
         she walked beneath the trees. She spoke no word, but beckoned to them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Turning aside, she led them towards the southern slopes of the hill of Caras Galadhon, and passing through a high green hedge&#13;
         they came into an enclosed garden. No trees grew there, and it lay open to the sky. The evening star had risen and was shining&#13;
         with white fire above the western woods. Down a long flight of steps the Lady went into the deep green hollow, through which&#13;
         ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountain on the hill. At the bottom, upon a low pedestal carved like&#13;
         a branching tree, stood a basin of silver, wide and shallow, and beside it stood a silver ewer.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>With water from the stream Galadriel filled the basin to the brim, and breathed on it, and when the water was still again&#13;
         she spoke. ‘Here is the Mirror of Galadriel,’ she said. ‘I have brought you here so that you may look in it, if you will.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The air was very still, and the dell was dark, and the Elf-lady beside him was tall and pale. ‘What shall we look for, and&#13;
         what shall we see?’ asked Frodo, filled with awe.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Many things I can command the Mirror to reveal,’ she answered, ‘and to some I can show what they desire to see. But the Mirror&#13;
         will also show things unbidden, and those are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold. What&#13;
         you will see, if you leave the Mirror free to &#13;
         <a id="page471"/>work, I cannot tell. For it shows things that were, and things that are, and things that yet may be. But which it is that&#13;
         he sees, even the wisest cannot always tell. Do you wish to look?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo did not answer.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘And you?’ she said, turning to Sam. ‘For this is what your folk would call magic, I believe; though I do not understand clearly&#13;
         what they mean; and they seem to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But this, if you will, is the magic of Galadriel.&#13;
         Did you not say that you wished to see Elf-magic?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I did,’ said Sam, trembling a little between fear and curiosity. ‘I’ll have a peep, Lady, if you’re willing.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘And I’d not mind a glimpse of what’s going on at home,’ he said in an aside to Frodo. ‘It seems a terrible long time that&#13;
         I’ve been away. But there, like as not I’ll only see the stars, or something that I won’t understand.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Like as not,’ said the Lady with a gentle laugh. ‘But come, you shall look and see what you may. Do not touch the water!’</p>&#13;
      <p>Sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin. The water looked hard and dark. Stars were reflected&#13;
         in it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There’s only stars, as I thought,’ he said. Then he gave a low gasp, for the stars went out. As if a dark veil had been withdrawn,&#13;
         the Mirror grew grey, and then clear. There was sun shining, and the branches of trees were waving and tossing in the wind.&#13;
         But before Sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo with a pale&#13;
         face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage, and climbing an&#13;
         endless winding stair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something, but what it was he did not know.&#13;
         Like a dream the vision shifted and went back, and he saw the trees again. But this time they were not so close, and he could&#13;
         see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they were falling, crashing to the ground.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page472"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Hi!’ cried Sam in an outraged voice. ‘There’s that Ted Sandyman a-cutting down trees as he shouldn’t. They didn’t ought to&#13;
         be felled: it’s that avenue beyond the Mill that shades the road to Bywater. I wish I could get at Ted, and I’d fell <em>him</em>!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But now Sam noticed that the Old Mill had vanished, and a large red-brick building was being put up where it had stood. Lots&#13;
         of folk were busily at work. There was a tall red chimney nearby. Black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the Mirror.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There’s some devilry at work in the Shire,’ he said. ‘Elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to send Mr. Merry back.’&#13;
         Then suddenly Sam gave a cry and sprang away. ‘I can’t stay here,’ he said wildly. ‘I must go home. They’ve dug up Bagshot&#13;
         Row, and there’s the poor old Gaffer going down the Hill with his bits of things on a barrow. I must go home!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You cannot go home alone,’ said the Lady. ‘You did not wish to go home without your master before you looked in the Mirror,&#13;
         and yet you knew that evil things might well be happening in the Shire. Remember that the Mirror shows many things, and not&#13;
         all have yet come to pass. Some never come to be, unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent&#13;
         them. The Mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam sat on the ground and put his head in his hands. ‘I wish I had never come here, and I don’t want to see no more magic,’&#13;
         he said and fell silent. After a moment he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears. ‘No, I’ll go home by the long&#13;
         road with Mr. Frodo, or not at all,’ he said. ‘But I hope I do get back some day. If what I’ve seen turns out true, somebody’s&#13;
         going to catch it hot!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">‘Do you now wish to look, Frodo?’ said the Lady Galadriel. ‘You did not wish to see Elf-magic and were content.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do you advise me to look?’ asked Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No,’ she said. ‘I do not counsel you one way or the other.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page473"/>&#13;
      <p>I am not a counsellor. You may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or evil, that may be profitable, and yet&#13;
         it may not. Seeing is both good and perilous. Yet I think, Frodo, that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture,&#13;
         or I would not have brought you here. Do as you will!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I will look,’ said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water. At once the Mirror cleared and he&#13;
         saw a twilit land. Mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky. A long grey road wound back out of sight. Far&#13;
         away a figure came slowly down the road, faint and small at first, but growing larger and clearer as it approached. Suddenly&#13;
         Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf. He almost called aloud the wizard’s name, and then he saw that the figure&#13;
         was clothed not in grey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its hand there was a white staff.&#13;
         The head was so bowed that he could see no face, and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out&#13;
         of the Mirror’s view. Doubt came into Frodo’s mind: was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago,&#13;
         or was it Saruman?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The vision now changed. Brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of Bilbo walking restlessly about his room. The&#13;
         table was littered with disordered papers; rain was beating on the windows.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history&#13;
         in which he had become involved. The mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at once: the&#13;
         Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose and raged in a great storm. Then he saw against the Sun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of&#13;
         clouds, the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of the West. Then a wide river flowing through a populous&#13;
         city. Then a white fortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, but now it was morning again, and the&#13;
         water rippled with light, and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun. A smoke &#13;
         <a id="page474"/>as of fire and battle arose, and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey mist; and into the mist a&#13;
         small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight, and Frodo looked into&#13;
         emptiness. In the black abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly all the Mirror. So terrible&#13;
         was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed,&#13;
         yellow as a cat’s, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things&#13;
         that it sought he himself was one. But he also knew that it could not see him – not yet, not unless he willed it. The Ring&#13;
         that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards. The Mirror&#13;
         seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the water. He was slipping forward.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Do not touch the water!’ said the Lady Galadriel softly. The vision faded, and Frodo found that he was looking at the cool&#13;
         stars twinkling in the silver basin. He stepped back shaking all over and looked at the Lady.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I know what it was that you last saw,’ she said; ‘for that is also in my mind. Do not be afraid! But do not think that only&#13;
         by singing amid the trees, nor even by the slender arrows of elven-bows, is this land of Lothlórien maintained and defended&#13;
         against its Enemy. I say to you, Frodo, that even as I speak to you, I perceive the Dark Lord and know his mind, or all of&#13;
         his mind that concerns the Elves. And he gropes ever to see me and my thought. But still the door is closed!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>She lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the East in a gesture of rejection and denial. Eärendil, the&#13;
         Evening Star, most beloved of the Elves, shone clear above. So bright was it that the figure of the Elven-lady cast &#13;
         <a id="page475"/>a dim shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a ring about her finger; it glittered like polished gold overlaid with silver&#13;
         light, and a white stone in it twinkled as if the Evenstar had come down to rest upon her hand. Frodo gazed at the ring with&#13;
         awe; for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ she said, divining his thought, ‘it is not permitted to speak of it, and Elrond could not do so. But it cannot be hidden&#13;
         from the Ring-bearer, and one who has seen the Eye. Verily it is in the land of Lórien upon the finger of Galadriel that one&#13;
         of the Three remains. This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its keeper.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He suspects, but he does not know – not yet. Do you not see now wherefore your coming is to us as the footstep of Doom? For&#13;
         if you fail, then we are laid bare to the Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is diminished, and Lothlórien will fade,&#13;
         and the tides of Time will sweep it away. We must depart into the West, or dwindle to a rustic folk of dell and cave, slowly&#13;
         to forget and to be forgotten.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo bent his head. ‘And what do you wish?’ he said at last.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That what should be shall be,’ she answered. ‘The love of the Elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps&#13;
         of the Sea, and their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged. Yet they will cast all away rather than submit&#13;
         to Sauron: for they know him now. For the fate of Lothlórien you are not answerable, but only for the doing of your own task.&#13;
         Yet I could wish, were it of any avail, that the One Ring had never been wrought, or had remained for ever lost.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You are wise and fearless and fair, Lady Galadriel,’ said Frodo. ‘I will give you the One Ring, if you ask for it. It is&#13;
         too great a matter for me.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh. ‘Wise the Lady Galadriel may be,’ she said, ‘yet here she has met her match in&#13;
         courtesy. Gently are you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting. You begin to see with a &#13;
         <a id="page476"/>keen eye. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer. For many long years I had pondered what I&#13;
         might do, should the Great Ring come into my hands, and behold! it was brought within my grasp. The evil that was devised&#13;
         long ago works on in many ways, whether Sauron himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a noble deed to set to the&#13;
         credit of his Ring, if I had taken it by force or fear from my guest?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And now at last it comes. You will give me the Ring freely! In place of the Dark Lord you will set up a Queen. And I shall&#13;
         not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! Fair as the Sea and the Sun and the Snow upon the Mountain!&#13;
         Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of the earth. All shall love me and despair!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>She lifted up her hand and from the ring that she wore there issued a great light that illumined her alone and left all else&#13;
         dark. She stood before Frodo seeming now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond enduring, terrible and worshipful.&#13;
         Then she let her hand fall, and the light faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and lo! she was shrunken: a slender elf-woman,&#13;
         clad in simple white, whose gentle voice was soft and sad.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I pass the test,’ she said. ‘I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">They stood for a long while in silence. At length the Lady spoke again. ‘Let us return!’ she said. ‘In the morning you must&#13;
         depart, for now we have chosen, and the tides of fate are flowing.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I would ask one thing before we go,’ said Frodo, ‘a thing which I often meant to ask Gandalf in Rivendell. I am permitted&#13;
         to wear the One Ring: why cannot <em>I</em> see all the others and know the thoughts of those that wear them?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You have not tried,’ she said. ‘Only thrice have you set the Ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed. Do&#13;
         not try! It would destroy you. Did not Gandalf &#13;
         <a id="page477"/>tell you that the rings give power according to the measure of each possessor? Before you could use that power you would need&#13;
         to become far stronger, and to train your will to the domination of others. Yet even so, as Ring-bearer and as one that has&#13;
         borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden, your sight is grown keener. You have perceived my thought more clearly than&#13;
         many that are accounted wise. You saw the Eye of him that holds the Seven and the Nine. And did you not see and recognize&#13;
         the ring upon my finger? Did you see my ring?’ she asked turning again to Sam.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, Lady,’ he answered. ‘To tell you the truth, I wondered what you were talking about. I saw a star through your fingers.&#13;
         But if you’ll pardon my speaking out, I think my master was right. I wish you’d take his Ring. You’d put things to rights.&#13;
         You’d stop them digging up the Gaffer and turning him adrift. You’d make some folk pay for their dirty work.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I would,’ she said. ‘That is how it would begin. But it would not stop with that, alas! We will not speak more of it. Let&#13;
         us go!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;

      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-20">FAREWELL TO LÓRIEN</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">That night the Company was again summoned to the chamber of Celeborn, and there the Lord and Lady greeted them with fair words.&#13;
         At length Celeborn spoke of their departure.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now is the time,’ he said, ‘when those who wish to continue the Quest must harden their hearts to leave this land. Those&#13;
         who no longer wish to go forward may remain here, for a while. But whether they stay or go, none can be sure of peace. For&#13;
         we are come now to the edge of doom. Here those who wish may await the oncoming of the hour till either the ways of the world&#13;
         lie open again, or we summon them to the last need of Lórien. Then they may return to their own lands, or else go to the long&#13;
         home of those that fall in battle.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There was a silence. ‘They all resolved to go forward,’ said Galadriel looking in their eyes.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘As for me,’ said Boromir, ‘my way home lies onward and not back.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is true,’ said Celeborn, ‘but is all this Company going with you to Minas Tirith?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We have not decided our course,’ said Aragorn. ‘Beyond Lothlórien I do not know what Gandalf intended to do. Indeed I do&#13;
         not think that even he had any clear purpose.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Maybe not,’ said Celeborn, ‘yet when you leave this land, you can no longer forget the Great River. As some of you know well,&#13;
         it cannot be crossed by travellers with baggage between Lórien and Gondor, save by boat. And are not the bridges of Osgiliath&#13;
         broken down and all the landings held now by the Enemy?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘On which side will you journey? The way to Minas Tirith lies upon this side, upon the west; but the straight road of the</p>&#13;
      <a id="page479"/>&#13;
      <p>Quest lies east of the River, upon the darker shore. Which shore will you now take?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘If my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way to Minas Tirith,’ answered Boromir. ‘But I am not the leader&#13;
         of the Company.’ The others said nothing, and Aragorn looked doubtful and troubled.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I see that you do not yet know what to do,’ said Celeborn. ‘It is not my part to choose for you; but I will help you as I&#13;
         may. There are some among you who can handle boats: Legolas, whose folk know the swift Forest River; and Boromir of Gondor;&#13;
         and Aragorn the traveller.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And one Hobbit!’ cried Merry. ‘Not all of us look on boats as wild horses. My people live by the banks of the Brandywine.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That is well,’ said Celeborn. ‘Then I will furnish your Company with boats. They must be small and light, for if you go far&#13;
         by water, there are places where you will be forced to carry them. You will come to the rapids of Sarn Gebir, and maybe at&#13;
         last to the great falls of Rauros where the River thunders down from Nen Hithoel; and there are other perils. Boats may make&#13;
         your journey less toilsome for a while. Yet they will not give you counsel: in the end you must leave them and the River,&#13;
         and turn west – or east.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Aragorn thanked Celeborn many times. The gift of boats comforted him much, not least because there would now be no need to&#13;
         decide his course for some days. The others, too, looked more hopeful. Whatever perils lay ahead, it seemed better to float&#13;
         down the broad tide of Anduin to meet them than to plod forward with bent backs. Only Sam was doubtful: he at any rate still&#13;
         thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse, and not all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before noon tomorrow,’ said Celeborn. ‘I will send my people to&#13;
         you in the morning to help you make ready for the journey. Now we will wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleep.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Good night, my friends!’ said Galadriel. ‘Sleep in peace!</p>&#13;
      <a id="page480"/>&#13;
      <p>Do not trouble your hearts overmuch with thought of the road tonight. Maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already&#13;
         laid before your feet, though you do not see them. Good night!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion. Legolas went with them, for this was to be their last night&#13;
         in Lothlórien, and in spite of the words of Galadriel they wished to take counsel together.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>For a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling of their purpose with&#13;
         the Ring; but they came to no decision. It was plain that most of them desired to go first to Minas Tirith, and to escape&#13;
         at least for a while from the terror of the Enemy. They would have been willing to follow a leader over the River and into&#13;
         the shadow of Mordor; but Frodo spoke no word, and Aragorn was still divided in his mind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>His own plan, while Gandalf remained with them, had been to go with Boromir, and with his sword help to deliver Gondor. For&#13;
         he believed that the message of the dreams was a summons, and that the hour had come at last when the heir of Elendil should&#13;
         come forth and strive with Sauron for the mastery. But in Moria the burden of Gandalf had been laid on him; and he knew that&#13;
         he could not now forsake the Ring, if Frodo refused in the end to go with Boromir. And yet what help could he or any of the&#13;
         Company give to Frodo, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I shall go to Minas Tirith, alone if need be, for it is my duty,’ said Boromir; and after that he was silent for a while,&#13;
         sitting with his eyes fixed on Frodo, as if he was trying to read the Halfling’s thoughts. At length he spoke again, softly,&#13;
         as if he was debating with himself. ‘If you wish only to destroy the Ring,’ he said, ‘then there is little use in war and&#13;
         weapons; and the Men of Minas Tirith cannot help. But if you wish to destroy the armed might of the Dark Lord, then it is&#13;
         folly to go without force into his domain; and folly to throw away.’ He paused suddenly, as if he had become aware that he&#13;
         was &#13;
         <a id="page481"/>speaking his thoughts aloud. ‘It would be folly to throw lives away, I mean,’ he ended. ‘It is a choice between defending&#13;
         a strong place and walking openly into the arms of death. At least, that is how I see it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo caught something new and strange in Boromir’s glance, and he looked hard at him. Plainly Boromir’s thought was different&#13;
         from his final words. It would be folly to throw away: what? The Ring of Power? He had said something like this at the Council,&#13;
         but then he had accepted the correction of Elrond. Frodo looked at Aragorn, but he seemed deep in his own thought and made&#13;
         no sign that he had heeded Boromir’s words. And so their debate ended. Merry and Pippin were already asleep, and Sam was nodding.&#13;
         The night was growing old.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and brought&#13;
         them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey. The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes, made of a meal that&#13;
         was baked a light brown on the outside, and inside was the colour of cream. Gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at it&#13;
         with a doubtful eye.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>Cram</em>,’ he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp corner and nibbled at it. His expression quickly changed, and he ate&#13;
         all the rest of the cake with relish.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No more, no more!’ cried the Elves laughing. ‘You have eaten enough already for a long day’s march.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I thought it was only a kind of <em>cram</em>, such as the Dale-men make for journeys in the wild,’ said the Dwarf.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So it is,’ they answered. ‘But we call it <em>lembas</em> or waybread, and it is more strengthening than any food made by Men, and it is more pleasant than <em>cram</em>, by all accounts.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Indeed it is,’ said Gimli. ‘Why, it is better than the honeycakes of the Beornings, and that is great praise, for the Beornings&#13;
         are the best bakers that I know of; but they are none too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in these days. You&#13;
         are kindly hosts!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page482"/>&#13;
      <p>‘All the same, we bid you spare the food,’ they said. ‘Eat little at a time, and only at need. For these things are given&#13;
         to serve you when all else fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many many days, if they are unbroken and left in their leaf-wrappings,&#13;
         as we have brought them. One will keep a traveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be one of the tall Men&#13;
         of Minas Tirith.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Company the clothes they had brought. For each they had provided a hood and&#13;
         cloak, made according to his size, of the light but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim wove. It was hard to say of what&#13;
         colour they were: grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they were moved, or set in another&#13;
         light, they were green as shadowed leaves, or brown as fallow fields by night, dusk-silver as water under the stars. Each&#13;
         cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Are these magic cloaks?’ asked Pippin, looking at them with wonder.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not know what you mean by that,’ answered the leader of the Elves. ‘They are fair garments, and the web is good, for&#13;
         it was made in this land. They are Elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf and branch, water and stone: they&#13;
         have the hue and beauty of all these things under the twilight of Lórien that we love; for we put the thought of all that&#13;
         we love into all that we make. Yet they are garments, not armour, and they will not turn shaft or blade. But they should serve&#13;
         you well: they are light to wear, and warm enough or cool enough at need. And you will find them a great aid in keeping out&#13;
         of the sight of unfriendly eyes, whether you walk among the stones or the trees. You are indeed high in the favour of the&#13;
         Lady! For she herself and her maidens wove this stuff; and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">After their morning meal the Company said farewell to the lawn by the fountain. Their hearts were heavy; for it was a &#13;
         <a id="page483"/>fair place, and it had become like home to them, though they could not count the days and nights that they had passed there.&#13;
         As they stood for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight, Haldir came walking towards them over the green grass&#13;
         of the glade. Frodo greeted him with delight.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have returned from the Northern Fences,’ said the Elf, ‘and I am sent now to be your guide again. The Dimrill Dale is full&#13;
         of vapour and clouds of smoke, and the mountains are troubled. There are noises in the deeps of the earth. If any of you had&#13;
         thought of returning northwards to your homes, you would not have been able to pass that way. But come! Your path now goes&#13;
         south.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As they walked through Caras Galadhon the green ways were empty; but in the trees above them many voices were murmuring and&#13;
         singing. They themselves went silently. At last Haldir led them down the southward slopes of the hill, and they came again&#13;
         to the great gate hung with lamps, and to the white bridge; and so they passed out and left the city of the Elves. Then they&#13;
         turned away from the paved road and took a path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn-trees, and passed on, winding&#13;
         through rolling woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and eastwards, towards the shores of the River.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high green wall. Passing through an opening they came&#13;
         suddenly out of the trees. Before them lay a long lawn of shining grass, studded with golden <em>elanor</em> that glinted in the sun. The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins: on the right and west the Silverlode&#13;
         flowed glittering; on the left and east the Great River rolled its broad waters, deep and dark. On the further shores the&#13;
         woodlands still marched on southwards as far as eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and bare. No mallorn lifted its&#13;
         gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of Lórien.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>On the bank of the Silverlode, at some distance up from the meeting of the streams, there was a hythe of white stones and&#13;
         white wood. By it were moored many boats and barges.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page484"/>&#13;
      <p>Some were brightly painted, and shone with silver and gold and green, but most were either white or grey. Three small grey&#13;
         boats had been made ready for the travellers, and in these the Elves stowed their goods. And they added also coils of rope,&#13;
         three to each boat. Slender they looked, but strong, silken to the touch, grey of hue like the elven-cloaks.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What are these?’ asked Sam, handling one that lay upon the greensward.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ropes indeed!’ answered an Elf from the boats. ‘Never travel far without a rope! And one that is long and strong and light.&#13;
         Such are these. They may be a help in many needs.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You don’t need to tell me that!’ said Sam. ‘I came without any, and I’ve been worried ever since. But I was wondering what&#13;
         these were made of, knowing a bit about rope-making: it’s in the family as you might say.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘They are made of <em>hithlain</em>,’ said the Elf, ‘but there is no time now to instruct you in the art of their making. Had we known that this craft delighted&#13;
         you, we could have taught you much. But now alas! unless you should at some time return hither, you must be content with our&#13;
         gift. May it serve you well!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come!’ said Haldir. ‘All is now ready for you. Enter the boats! But take care at first!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Heed the words!’ said the other Elves. ‘These boats are light-built, and they are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk.&#13;
         They will not sink, lade them as you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It would be wise if you accustomed yourselves&#13;
         to stepping in and out, here where there is a landing-place, before you set off downstream.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo, and Sam were in one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in another; and&#13;
         in the third were Legolas and Gimli, who had now become fast friends. In this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed.&#13;
         The boats were moved and steered with short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped blades. When all was ready Aragorn&#13;
         led them on a trial up &#13;
         <a id="page485"/>the Silverlode. The current was swift and they went forward slowly. Sam sat in the bows, clutching the sides, and looking&#13;
         back wistfully to the shore. The sunlight glittering on the water dazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond the green field&#13;
         of the Tongue, the trees drew down to the river’s brink. Here and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream.&#13;
         The air was very bright and still, and there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They turned a sharp bend in the river, and there, sailing proudly down the stream towards them, they saw a swan of great size.&#13;
         The water rippled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak shone like burnished gold, and its&#13;
         eyes glinted like jet set in yellow stones; its huge white wings were half lifted. A music came down the river as it drew&#13;
         nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship, wrought and carved with elven-skill in the likeness of a bird. Two&#13;
         elves clad in white steered it with black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat Celeborn, and behind him stood Galadriel,&#13;
         tall and white; a circlet of golden flowers was in her hair, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang. Sad and sweet&#13;
         was the sound of her voice in the cool clear air:&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="vext1"><em>I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Beyond the Sun, beyond the Moon, the foam was on the Sea,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And by the strand of Ilmarin there grew a golden Tree.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in Eldamar it shone,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>In Eldamar beside the walls of Elven Tirion.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>There long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching years,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>While here beyond the Sundering Seas now fall the Elven-tears.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>O Lórien! The Winter comes, the bare and leafless Day;</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>The leaves are falling in the stream, the River flows away.</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>O Lórien! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither Shore</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>And in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor.</em></p>&#13;
      <a id="page486"/>&#13;
      <p class="vext"><em>But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me,</em></p>&#13;
      <p class="vext-3"><em>What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a Sea?</em></p>&#13;
      <p>Aragorn stayed his boat as the Swan-ship drew alongside. The Lady ended her song and greeted them. ‘We have come to bid our&#13;
         last farewell,’ she said, ‘and to speed you with blessings from our land.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Though you have been our guests,’ said Celeborn, ‘you have not yet eaten with us, and we bid you, therefore, to a parting&#13;
         feast, here between the flowing waters that will bear you far from Lórien.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Swan passed on slowly to the hythe, and they turned their boats and followed it. There in the last end of Egladil upon&#13;
         the green grass the parting feast was held; but Frodo ate and drank little, heeding only the beauty of the Lady and her voice.&#13;
         She seemed no longer perilous or terrible, nor filled with hidden power. Already she seemed to him, as by men of later days&#13;
         Elves still at times are seen: present and yet remote, a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the&#13;
         flowing streams of Time.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">After they had eaten and drunk, sitting upon the grass, Celeborn spoke to them again of their journey, and lifting his hand&#13;
         he pointed south to the woods beyond the Tongue.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘As you go down the water,’ he said, ‘you will find that the trees will fail, and you will come to a barren country. There&#13;
         the River flows in stony vales amid high moors, until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall island of the Tindrock,&#13;
         that we call Tol Brandir. There it casts its arms about the steep shores of the isle, and falls then with a great noise and&#13;
         smoke over the cataracts of Rauros down into the Nindalf, the Wetwang as it is called in your tongue. That is a wide region&#13;
         of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the Entwash flows in by many mouths from the Forest&#13;
         of Fangorn in the west. About that stream, on this side of the Great River, lies Rohan. On the &#13;
         <a id="page487"/>further side are the bleak hills of the Emyn Muil. The wind blows from the East there, for they look out over the Dead Marshes&#13;
         and the Noman-lands to Cirith Gorgor and the black gates of Mordor.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Boromir, and any that go with him seeking Minas Tirith, will do well to leave the Great River above Rauros and cross the&#13;
         Entwash before it finds the marshes. Yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor risk becoming entangled in the Forest&#13;
         of Fangorn. That is a strange land, and is now little known. But Boromir and Aragorn doubtless do not need this warning.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Indeed we have heard of Fangorn in Minas Tirith,’ said Boromir. ‘But what I have heard seems to me for the most part old&#13;
         wives’ tales, such as we tell to our children. All that lies north of Rohan is now to us so far away that fancy can wander&#13;
         freely there. Of old Fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm; but it is now many lives of men since any of us visited it,&#13;
         to prove or disprove the legends that have come down from distant years.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have myself been at whiles in Rohan, but I have never crossed it northwards. When I was sent out as a messenger, I passed&#13;
         through the Gap by the skirts of the White Mountains, and crossed the Isen and the Greyflood into Northerland. A long and&#13;
         wearisome journey. Four hundred leagues I reckoned it, and it took me many months; for I lost my horse at Tharbad, at the&#13;
         fording of the Greyflood. After that journey, and the road I have trodden with this Company, I do not much doubt that I shall&#13;
         find a way through Rohan, and Fangorn too, if need be.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then I need say no more,’ said Celeborn. ‘But do not despise the lore that has come down from distant years; for oft it may&#13;
         chance that old wives keep in memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Now Galadriel rose from the grass, and taking a cup from one of her maidens she filled it with white mead and gave it to Celeborn.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page488"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Now it is time to drink the cup of farewell,’ she said. ‘Drink, Lord of the Galadhrim! And let not your heart be sad, though&#13;
         night must follow noon, and already our evening draweth nigh.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then she brought the cup to each of the Company, and bade them drink and farewell. But when they had drunk she commanded them&#13;
         to sit again on the grass, and chairs were set for her and for Celeborn. Her maidens stood silent about her, and a while she&#13;
         looked upon her guests. At last she spoke again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We have drunk the cup of parting,’ she said, ‘and the shadows fall between us. But before you go, I have brought in my ship&#13;
         gifts which the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim now offer you in memory of Lothlórien.’ Then she called to each in turn.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here is the gift of Celeborn and Galadriel to the leader of your Company,’ she said to Aragorn, and she gave him a sheath&#13;
         that had been made to fit his sword. It was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves wrought of silver and gold, and&#13;
         on it were set in elven-runes formed of many gems the name Andúril and the lineage of the sword.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even in defeat,’ she said. ‘But is there aught else&#13;
         that you desire of me at our parting? For darkness will flow between us, and it may be that we shall not meet again, unless&#13;
         it be far hence upon a road that has no returning.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>And Aragorn answered: ‘Lady, you know all my desire, and long held in keeping the only treasure that I seek. Yet it is not&#13;
         yours to give me, even if you would; and only through darkness shall I come to it.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yet maybe this will lighten your heart,’ said Galadriel; ‘for it was left in my care to be given to you, should you pass&#13;
         through this land.’ Then she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green, set in a silver brooch that was wrought in&#13;
         the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings; and as she held it up the gem flashed like the sun shining through the leaves&#13;
         of spring. ‘This stone I gave to Celebrían my daughter, and &#13;
         <a id="page489"/>she to hers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope. In this hour take the name that was foretold for you, Elessar, the&#13;
         Elfstone of the House of Elendil!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then Aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and those who saw him wondered; for they had not marked&#13;
         before how tall and kingly he stood, and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen from his shoulders. ‘For the&#13;
         gifts that you have given me I thank you,’ he said, ‘O Lady of Lórien of whom were sprung Celebrían and Arwen Evenstar. What&#13;
         praise could I say more?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Lady bowed her head, and she turned then to Boromir, and to him she gave a belt of gold; and to Merry and Pippin she gave&#13;
         small silver belts, each with a clasp wrought like a golden flower. To Legolas she gave a bow such as the Galadhrim used,&#13;
         longer and stouter than the bows of Mirkwood, and strung with a string of elf-hair. With it went a quiver of arrows.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘For you little gardener and lover of trees,’ she said to Sam, ‘I have only a small gift.’ She put into his hand a little&#13;
         box of plain grey wood, unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid. ‘Here is set G for Galadriel,’ she said; ‘but&#13;
         also it may stand for garden in your tongue. In this box there is earth from my orchard, and such blessing as Galadriel has&#13;
         still to bestow is upon it. It will not keep you on your road, nor defend you against any peril; but if you keep it and see&#13;
         your home again at last, then perhaps it may reward you. Though you should find all barren and laid waste, there will be few&#13;
         gardens in Middle-earth that will bloom like your garden, if you sprinkle this earth there. Then you may remember Galadriel,&#13;
         and catch a glimpse far off of Lórien, that you have seen only in our winter. For our Spring and our Summer are gone by, and&#13;
         they will never be seen on earth again save in memory.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible, as he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves?’ said Galadriel, turning to Gimli.</p>&#13;
      <a id="page490"/>&#13;
      <p>‘None, Lady,’ answered Gimli. ‘It is enough for me to have seen the Lady of the Galadhrim, and to have heard her gentle words.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Hear all ye Elves!’ she cried to those about her. ‘Let none say again that Dwarves are grasping and ungracious! Yet surely,&#13;
         Gimli son of Glóin, you desire something that I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall not be the only guest without a&#13;
         gift.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘There is nothing, Lady Galadriel,’ said Gimli, bowing low and stammering. ‘Nothing, unless it might be – unless it is permitted&#13;
         to ask, nay, to name a single strand of your hair, which surpasses the gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gems of&#13;
         the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But you commanded me to name my desire.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Elves stirred and murmured with astonishment, and Celeborn gazed at the Dwarf in wonder, but the Lady smiled. ‘It is said&#13;
         that the skill of the Dwarves is in their hands rather than in their tongues,’ she said; ‘yet that is not true of Gimli. For&#13;
         none have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteous. And how shall I refuse, since I commanded him to speak?&#13;
         But tell me, what would you do with such a gift?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Treasure it, Lady,’ he answered, ‘in memory of your words to me at our first meeting. And if ever I return to the smithies&#13;
         of my home, it shall be set in imperishable crystal to be an heirloom of my house, and a pledge of good will between the Mountain&#13;
         and the Wood until the end of days.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then the Lady unbraided one of her long tresses, and cut off three golden hairs, and laid them in Gimli’s hand. ‘These words&#13;
         shall go with the gift,’ she said. ‘I do not foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the one hand lies darkness, and&#13;
         on the other only hope. But if hope should not fail, then I say to you, Gimli son of Glóin, that your hands shall flow with&#13;
         gold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And you, Ring-bearer,’ she said, turning to Frodo. ‘I come to you last who are not last in my thoughts. For you I have prepared&#13;
         this.’ She held up a small crystal phial: it glittered &#13;
         <a id="page491"/>as she moved it, and rays of white light sprang from her hand. ‘In this phial,’ she said, ‘is caught the light of Eärendil’s&#13;
         star, set amid the waters of my fountain. It will shine still brighter when night is about you. May it be a light to you in&#13;
         dark places, when all other lights go out. Remember Galadriel and her Mirror!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo took the phial, and for a moment as it shone between them, he saw her again standing like a queen, great and beautiful,&#13;
         but no longer terrible. He bowed, but found no words to say.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Now the Lady arose, and Celeborn led them back to the hythe. A yellow noon lay on the green land of the Tongue, and the water&#13;
         glittered with silver. All at last was made ready. The Company took their places in the boats as before. Crying farewell,&#13;
         the Elves of Lórien with long grey poles thrust them out into the flowing stream, and the rippling waters bore them slowly&#13;
         away. The travellers sat still without moving or speaking. On the green bank near to the very point of the Tongue the Lady&#13;
         Galadriel stood alone and silent. As they passed her they turned and their eyes watched her slowly floating away from them.&#13;
         For so it seemed to them: Lórien was slipping backward, like a bright ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing on to forgotten&#13;
         shores, while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey and leafless world.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Even as they gazed, the Silverlode passed out into the currents of the Great River, and their boats turned and began to speed&#13;
         southward. Soon the white form of the Lady was small and distant. She shone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the&#13;
         westering sun, or as a remote lake seen from a mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap of the land. Then it seemed to Frodo&#13;
         that she lifted her arms in a final farewell, and far but piercing-clear on the following wind came the sound of her voice&#13;
         singing. But now she sang in the ancient tongue of the Elves beyond the Sea, and he did not understand the words: fair was&#13;
         the music, but it did not comfort him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page492"/>&#13;
      <p>Yet as is the way of Elvish words, they remained graven in his memory, and long afterwards he interpreted them, as well as&#13;
         he could: the language was that of Elven-song and spoke of things little known on Middle-earth.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

      <p>‘Ah! like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as the wings of trees! The years have passed like swift&#13;
         draughts of the sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West, beneath the blue vaults of Varda wherein the stars tremble in the&#13;
         song of her voice, holy and queenly. Who now shall refill the cup for me? For now the Kindler, Varda, the Queen of the Stars,&#13;
         from Mount Everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds, and all paths are drowned deep in shadow; and out of a grey country&#13;
         darkness lies on the foaming waves between us, and mist covers the jewels of Calacirya for ever. Now lost, lost to those from&#13;
         the East is Valimar! Farewell!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page493"/>&#13;
      <p>Maybe thou shalt find Valimar. Maybe even thou shalt find it. Farewell!’ Varda is the name of that Lady whom the Elves in&#13;
         these lands of exile name Elbereth.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Suddenly the River swept round a bend, and the banks rose upon either side, and the light of Lórien was hidden. To that fair&#13;
         land Frodo never came again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The travellers now turned their faces to the journey; the sun was before them, and their eyes were dazzled, for all were filled&#13;
         with tears. Gimli wept openly.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I have looked the last upon that which was fairest,’ he said to Legolas his companion. ‘Henceforward I will call nothing&#13;
         fair, unless it be her gift.’ He put his hand to his breast.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Tell me, Legolas, why did I come on this Quest? Little did I know where the chief peril lay! Truly Elrond spoke, saying that&#13;
         we could not foresee what we might meet upon our road. Torment in the dark was the danger that I feared, and it did not hold&#13;
         me back. But I would not have come, had I known the danger of light and joy. Now I have taken my worst wound in this parting,&#13;
         even if I were to go this night straight to the Dark Lord. Alas for Gimli son of Glóin!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Nay!’ said Legolas. ‘Alas for us all! And for all that walk the world in these after-days. For such is the way of it: to&#13;
         find and lose, as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed, Gimli son of Glóin: for&#13;
         your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you might have chosen otherwise. But you have not forsaken your companions,&#13;
         and the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of Lothlórien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your heart,&#13;
         and shall neither fade nor grow stale.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Maybe,’ said Gimli; ‘and I thank you for your words. True words doubtless; yet all such comfort is cold. Memory is not what&#13;
         the heart desires. That is only a mirror, be it clear as Kheled-zâram. Or so says the heart of Gimli the Dwarf. Elves may&#13;
         see things otherwise. Indeed I have heard that for them memory is more like to the waking world than to a dream. Not so for&#13;
         Dwarves.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page494"/>&#13;
      <p>‘But let us talk no more of it. Look to the boat! She is too low in the water with all this baggage, and the Great River is&#13;
         swift. I do not wish to drown my grief in cold water.’ He took up a paddle, and steered towards the western bank, following&#13;
         Aragorn’s boat ahead, which had already moved out of the middle stream.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">So the Company went on their long way, down the wide hurrying waters, borne ever southwards. Bare woods stalked along either&#13;
         bank, and they could not see any glimpse of the lands behind. The breeze died away and the River flowed without a sound. No&#13;
         voice of bird broke the silence. The sun grew misty as the day grew old, until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white&#13;
         pearl. Then it faded into the West, and dusk came early, followed by a grey and starless night. Far into the dark quiet hours&#13;
         they floated on, guiding their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western woods. Great trees passed by like ghosts,&#13;
         thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the mist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. Frodo sat and listened&#13;
         to the faint lap and gurgle of the River fretting among the tree-roots and driftwood near the shore, until his head nodded&#13;
         and he fell into an uneasy sleep.&#13;

            <em>Chapter</em> 9</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="ct"><a href="Fellowshipofth_toc.html#chap-21">THE GREAT RIVER</a></p>&#13;
      <p class="cotx">Frodo was roused by Sam. He found that he was lying, well wrapped, under tall grey-skinned trees in a quiet corner of the&#13;
         woodlands on the west bank of the Great River, Anduin. He had slept the night away, and the grey of morning was dim among&#13;
         the bare branches. Gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They started again before the day was broad. Not that most of the Company were eager to hurry southwards: they were content&#13;
         that the decision, which they must make at latest when they came to Rauros and the Tindrock Isle, still lay some days ahead;&#13;
         and they let the River bear them on at its own pace, having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond, whichever&#13;
         course they took in the end. Aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished, husbanding their strength against weariness&#13;
         to come. But he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey on far into the evening; for he felt in&#13;
         his heart that time was pressing, and he feared that the Dark Lord had not been idle while they lingered in Lórien.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Nonetheless they saw no sign of any enemy that day, nor the next. The dull grey hours passed without event. As the third day&#13;
         of their voyage wore on the lands changed slowly: the trees thinned and then failed altogether. On the eastern bank to their&#13;
         left they saw long formless slopes stretching up and away towards the sky; brown and withered they looked, as if fire had&#13;
         passed over them, leaving no living blade of green: an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve&#13;
         the emptiness. They had come to the Brown Lands that lay, vast and desolate, between Southern Mirkwood and the hills of the&#13;
         Emyn Muil. What pestilence &#13;
         <a id="page496"/>or war or evil deed of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Upon the west to their right the land was treeless also, but it was flat, and in many places green with wide plains of grass.&#13;
         On this side of the River they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all view to the west, as the little&#13;
         boats went rustling by along their fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light cold airs,&#13;
         hissing softly and sadly. Here and there through openings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads, and far beyond&#13;
         them hills in the sunset, and away on the edge of sight a dark line, where marched the southernmost ranks of the Misty Mountains.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There was no sign of living moving things, save birds. Of these there were many: small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds,&#13;
         but they were seldom seen. Once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of swan-wings, and looking up they saw a&#13;
         great phalanx streaming along the sky.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Swans!’ said Sam. ‘And mighty big ones too!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Aragorn, ‘and they are black swans.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘How wide and empty and mournful all this country looks!’ said Frodo. ‘I always imagined that as one journeyed south it got&#13;
         warmer and merrier, until winter was left behind for ever.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But we have not journeyed far south yet,’ answered Aragorn. ‘It is still winter, and we are far from the sea. Here the world&#13;
         is cold until the sudden spring, and we may yet have snow again. Far away down in the Bay of Belfalas, to which Anduin runs,&#13;
         it is warm and merry, maybe, or would be but for the Enemy. But here we are not above sixty leagues, I guess, south of the&#13;
         Southfarthing away in your Shire, hundreds of long miles yonder. You are looking now south-west across the north plains of&#13;
         the Riddermark, Rohan the land of the Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight that runs down from&#13;
         Fangorn to join the Great River. That is the north boundary of Rohan; and of old all that lay between Limlight and the White&#13;
         Mountains belonged &#13;
         <a id="page497"/>to the Rohirrim. It is a rich and pleasant land, and its grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the&#13;
         River or ride often to its shores. Anduin is wide, yet the orcs can shoot their arrows far across the stream; and of late,&#13;
         it is said, they have dared to cross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily. The trees had seemed hostile before, as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers;&#13;
         now he wished that the trees were still there. He felt that the Company was too naked, afloat in little open boats in the&#13;
         midst of shelterless lands, and on a river that was the frontier of war.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>In the next day or two, as they went on, borne steadily southwards, this feeling of insecurity grew on all the Company. For&#13;
         a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forward. The banks slid by. Soon the River broadened and grew more shallow;&#13;
         long stony beaches lay upon the east, and there were gravel-shoals in the water, so that careful steering was needed. The&#13;
         Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air from the East. On the other side the meads had become rolling&#13;
         downs of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking of the lawns and fountains, the clear sun&#13;
         and gentle rains of Lothlórien. There was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats. Each member of the Company was&#13;
         busy with his own thoughts.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech-woods; Gimli was&#13;
         fingering gold in his mind, and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the Lady’s gift. Merry and Pippin&#13;
         in the middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness&#13;
         or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn’s. Then Pippin, who sat in the&#13;
         bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo. Sam had long ago made up his mind&#13;
         that, though boats were &#13;
         <a id="page498"/>maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined. He&#13;
         was cramped and miserable, having nothing to do but stare at the winter-lands crawling by and the grey water on either side&#13;
         of him. Even when the paddles were in use they did not trust Sam with one.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats;&#13;
         he was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his sight: at first he stared&#13;
         at it listlessly, then he sat up and rubbed his eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">That night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank. Sam lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo. ‘I had a funny&#13;
         dream an hour or two before we stopped, Mr. Frodo,’ he said. ‘Or maybe it wasn’t a dream. Funny it was anyway.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, what was it?’ said Frodo, knowing that Sam would not settle down until he had told his tale, whatever it was. ‘I haven’t&#13;
         seen or thought of anything to make me smile since we left Lothlórien.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It wasn’t funny that way, Mr. Frodo. It was queer. All wrong, if it wasn’t a dream. And you had best hear it. It was like&#13;
         this: I saw a log with eyes!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘The log’s all right,’ said Frodo. ‘There are many in the River. But leave out the eyes!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘That I won’t,’ said Sam. ‘’Twas the eyes as made me sit up, so to speak. I saw what I took to be a log floating along in&#13;
         the half-light behind Gimli’s boat; but I didn’t give much heed to it. Then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us&#13;
         up. And that was peculiar, as you might say, seeing as we were all floating on the stream together. Just then I saw the eyes:&#13;
         two pale sort of points, shiny-like, on a hump at the near end of the log. What’s more, it wasn’t a log, for it had paddle-feet,&#13;
         like a swan’s almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page499"/>&#13;
      <p>‘That’s when I sat right up and rubbed my eyes, meaning to give a shout, if it was still there when I had rubbed the drowse&#13;
         out of my head. For the whatever-it-was was coming along fast now and getting close behind Gimli. But whether those two lamps&#13;
         spotted me moving and staring, or whether I came to my senses, I don’t know. When I looked again, it wasn’t there. Yet I think&#13;
         I caught a glimpse, with the tail of my eye, as the saying is, of something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank. I&#13;
         couldn’t see no more eyes, though.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I said to myself: “dreaming again, Sam Gamgee,” I said; and I said no more just then. But I’ve been thinking since, and now&#13;
         I’m not so sure. What do you make of it, Mr. Frodo?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your eyes, Sam,’ said Frodo, ‘if this was the first time&#13;
         that those eyes had been seen. But it isn’t. I saw them away back north before we reached Lórien. And I saw a strange creature&#13;
         with eyes climbing to the flet that night. Haldir saw it too. And do you remember the report of the Elves that went after&#13;
         the orc-band?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah,’ said Sam, ‘I do; and I remember more too. I don’t like my thoughts; but thinking of one thing and another, and Mr. Bilbo’s&#13;
         stories and all, I fancy I could put a name on the creature, at a guess. A nasty name. Gollum, maybe?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes, that is what I have feared for some time,’ said Frodo. ‘Ever since the night on the flet. I suppose he was lurking in&#13;
         Moria, and picked up our trail then; but I hoped that our stay in Lórien would throw him off the scent again. The miserable&#13;
         creature must have been hiding in the woods by the Silverlode, watching us start off!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That’s about it,’ said Sam. ‘And we’d better be a bit more watchful ourselves, or we’ll feel some nasty fingers round our&#13;
         necks one of these nights, if we ever wake up to feel anything. And that’s what I was leading up to. No need to trouble Strider&#13;
         or the others tonight. I’ll keep watch. I can sleep tomorrow, being no more than luggage in a boat, as you might say.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page500"/>&#13;
      <p>‘I might,’ said Frodo, ‘and I might say “luggage with eyes”. You shall watch; but only if you promise to wake me half-way&#13;
         towards morning, if nothing happens before then.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">In the dead hours Frodo came out of a deep dark sleep to find Sam shaking him. ‘It’s a shame to wake you,’ whispered Sam,&#13;
         ‘but that’s what you said. There’s nothing to tell, or not much. I thought I heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise,&#13;
         a while back; but you hear a lot of such queer sounds by a river at night.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He lay down, and Frodo sat up, huddled in his blankets, and fought off his sleep. Minutes or hours passed slowly, and nothing&#13;
         happened. Frodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape, hardly visible, floated close to&#13;
         one of the moored boats. A long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike&#13;
         eyes shone coldly as they peered inside, and then they lifted and gazed up at Frodo on the eyot. They were not more than a&#13;
         yard or two away, and Frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting from its sheath, and faced the&#13;
         eyes. Immediately their light was shut off. There was another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream&#13;
         into the night. Aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What is it?’ he whispered, springing up and coming to Frodo. ‘I felt something in my sleep. Why have you drawn your sword?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Gollum,’ answered Frodo. ‘Or at least, so I guess.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah!’ said Aragorn. ‘So you know about our little footpad, do you? He padded after us all through Moria and right down to&#13;
         Nimrodel. Since we took to boats, he has been lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet. I have tried to catch him once&#13;
         or twice at night; but he is slier than a fox, and as slippery as a fish. I hoped the river-voyage would beat him, but he&#13;
         is too clever a waterman.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We shall have to try going faster tomorrow. You lie down now, and I will keep watch for what is left of the night. I wish</p>&#13;
      <a id="page501"/>&#13;
      <p>I could lay my hands on the wretch. We might make him useful. But if I cannot, we shall have to try and lose him. He is very&#13;
         dangerous. Quite apart from murder by night on his own account, he may put any enemy that is about on our track.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The night passed without Gollum showing so much as a shadow again. After that the Company kept a sharp look-out, but they&#13;
         saw no more of Gollum while the voyage lasted. If he was still following, he was very wary and cunning. At Aragorn’s bidding&#13;
         they paddled now for long spells, and the banks went swiftly by. But they saw little of the country, for they journeyed mostly&#13;
         by night and twilight, resting by day, and lying as hidden as the land allowed. In this way the time passed without event&#13;
         until the seventh day.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The weather was still grey and overcast, with wind from the East, but as evening drew into night the sky away westward cleared,&#13;
         and pools of faint light, yellow and pale green, opened under the grey shores of cloud. There the white rind of the new Moon&#13;
         could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes. Sam looked at it and puckered his brows.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The next day the country on either side began to change rapidly. The banks began to rise and grow stony. Soon they were passing&#13;
         through a hilly rocky land, and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and sloe, tangled with&#13;
         brambles and creepers. Behind them stood low crumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and beyond&#13;
         these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs. They were drawing near to the grey hill-country of the&#13;
         Emyn Muil, the southern march of Wilderland.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-chimneys, and all day high in the air flocks of birds had been circling,&#13;
         black against the pale sky. As they lay in their camp that day Aragorn watched the flights doubtfully, wondering if Gollum&#13;
         had been doing some mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the wilderness. Later as the &#13;
         <a id="page502"/>sun was setting, and the Company was stirring and getting ready to start again, he descried a dark spot against the fading&#13;
         light: a great bird high and far off, now wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What is that, Legolas?’ he asked, pointing to the northern sky. ‘Is it, as I think, an eagle?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Legolas. ‘It is an eagle, a hunting eagle. I wonder what that forebodes. It is far from the mountains.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘We will not start until it is fully dark,’ said Aragorn.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The eighth night of their journey came. It was silent and windless; the grey east wind had passed away. The thin crescent&#13;
         of the Moon had fallen early into the pale sunset, but the sky was clear above, and though far away in the South there were&#13;
         great ranges of cloud that still shone faintly, in the West stars glinted bright.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come!’ said Aragorn. ‘We will venture one more journey by night. We are coming to reaches of the River that I do not know&#13;
         well; for I have never journeyed by water in these parts before, not between here and the rapids of Sarn Gebir. But if I am&#13;
         right in my reckoning, those are still many miles ahead. Still there are dangerous places even before we come there: rocks&#13;
         and stony eyots in the stream. We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>To Sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman. He lay forward peering into the gloom. The night grew dark, but&#13;
         the stars above were strangely bright, and there was a glimmer on the face of the River. It was close on midnight, and they&#13;
         had been drifting for some while, hardly using the paddles, when suddenly Sam cried out. Only a few yards ahead dark shapes&#13;
         loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water. There was a swift current which swung left, towards the eastern&#13;
         shore where the channel was clear. As they were swept aside the travellers could see, now very close, the pale foam of the&#13;
         River lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth. The boats were all huddled&#13;
         together.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page503"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Hoy there, Aragorn!’ shouted Boromir, as his boat bumped into the leader. ‘This is madness! We cannot dare the Rapids by&#13;
         night! But no boat can live in Sarn Gebir, be it night or day.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Back, back!’ cried Aragorn. ‘Turn! Turn if you can!’ He drove his paddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and bring&#13;
         it round.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I am out of my reckoning,’ he said to Frodo. ‘I did not know that we had come so far: Anduin flows faster than I thought.&#13;
         Sarn Gebir must be close at hand already.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">With great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them about; but at first they could make only small headway against&#13;
         the current, and all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank. Now dark and ominous it loomed up in&#13;
         the night.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All together, paddle!’ shouted Boromir. ‘Paddle! Or we shall be driven on the shoals.’ Even as he spoke Frodo felt the keel&#13;
         beneath him grate upon stone.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At that moment there was a twang of bowstrings: several arrows whistled over them, and some fell among them. One smote Frodo&#13;
         between the shoulders and he lurched forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell back, foiled by his hidden&#13;
         coat of mail. Another passed through Aragorn’s hood; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the second boat, close by Merry’s&#13;
         hand. Sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long shingle-banks that lay under the eastern&#13;
         shore. They seemed very near.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>Yrch!</em>’ said Legolas, falling into his own tongue.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Orcs!’ cried Gimli.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Gollum’s doing, I’ll be bound,’ said Sam to Frodo. ‘And a nice place to choose, too. The River seems set on taking us right&#13;
         into their arms!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even Sam took a hand. Every moment they expected to feel the bite of black-feathered&#13;
         arrows. Many whined overhead or struck the &#13;
         <a id="page504"/>water nearby; but there were no more hits. It was dark, but not too dark for the night-eyes of Orcs, and in the star-glimmer&#13;
         they must have offered their cunning foes some mark, unless it was that the grey cloaks of Lórien and the grey timber of the&#13;
         elf-wrought boats defeated the malice of the archers of Mordor.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Stroke by stroke they laboured on. In the darkness it was hard to be sure that they were indeed moving at all; but slowly&#13;
         the swirl of the water grew less, and the shadow of the eastern bank faded back into the night. At last, as far as they could&#13;
         judge, they had reached the middle of the stream again and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks.&#13;
         Then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towards the western shore. Under the shadow of bushes leaning out&#13;
         over the water they halted and drew breath.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Legolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from Lórien. Then he sprang ashore and climbed a few&#13;
         paces up the bank. Stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned, peering back over the River into the darkness. Across&#13;
         the water there were shrill cries, but nothing could be seen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him, as he gazed into the night, seeking a mark to shoot at. His head was dark,&#13;
         crowned with sharp white stars that glittered in the black pools of the sky behind. But now rising and sailing up from the&#13;
         South the great clouds advanced, sending out dark outriders into the starry fields. A sudden dread fell on the Company.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘<em>Elbereth Gilthoniel!</em>’ sighed Legolas as he looked up. Even as he did so, a dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud, for it moved far more&#13;
         swiftly, came out of the blackness in the South, and sped towards the Company, blotting out all light as it approached. Soon&#13;
         it appeared as a great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night. Fierce voices rose up to greet it from across&#13;
         the water. Frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching at his heart; there was a &#13;
         <a id="page505"/>deadly cold, like the memory of an old wound, in his shoulder. He crouched down, as if to hide.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly the great bow of Lórien sang. Shrill went the arrow from the elven-string. Frodo looked up. Almost above him the&#13;
         winged shape swerved. There was a harsh croaking scream, as it fell out of the air, vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern&#13;
         shore. The sky was clean again. There was a tumult of many voices far away, cursing and wailing in the darkness, and then&#13;
         silence. Neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">After a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream. They felt their way along the water’s edge for some distance, until they&#13;
         found a small shallow bay. A few low trees grew there close to the water, and behind them rose a steep rocky bank. Here the&#13;
         Company decided to stay and await the dawn: it was useless to attempt to move further by night. They made no camp and lit&#13;
         no fire, but lay huddled in the boats, moored close together.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Praised be the bow of Galadriel, and the hand and eye of Legolas!’ said Gimli, as he munched a wafer of <em>lembas</em>. ‘That was a mighty shot in the dark, my friend!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But who can say what it hit?’ said Legolas.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I cannot,’ said Gimli. ‘But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer. I liked it not at all. Too much it reminded me of the&#13;
         shadow in Moria – the shadow of the Balrog,’ he ended in a whisper.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘It was not a Balrog,’ said Frodo, still shivering with the chill that had come upon him. ‘It was something colder. I think&#13;
         it was——’ Then he paused and fell silent.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘What do you think?’ asked Boromir eagerly, leaning from his boat, as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of Frodo’s face.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I think— No, I will not say,’ answered Frodo. ‘Whatever it was, its fall has dismayed our enemies.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘So it seems,’ said Aragorn. ‘Yet where they are, and how many, and what they will do next, we do not know. This night we&#13;
         must all be sleepless! Dark hides us now. But what &#13;
         <a id="page506"/>the day will show who can tell? Have your weapons close to hand!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Sam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his fingers, and looking up at the sky. ‘It’s very strange,’&#13;
         he murmured. ‘The Moon’s the same in the Shire and in Wilderland, or it ought to be. But either it’s out of its running, or&#13;
         I’m all wrong in my reckoning. You’ll remember, Mr. Frodo, the Moon was waning as we lay on the flet up in that tree: a week&#13;
         from the full, I reckon. And we’d been a week on the way last night, when up pops a New Moon as thin as a nail-paring, as&#13;
         if we had never stayed no time in the Elvish country.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, I can remember three nights there for certain, and I seem to remember several more, but I would take my oath it was&#13;
         never a whole month. Anyone would think that time did not count in there!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And perhaps that was the way of it,’ said Frodo. ‘In that land, maybe, we were in a time that has elsewhere long gone by.&#13;
         It was not, I think, until Silverlode bore us back to Anduin that we returned to the time that flows through mortal lands&#13;
         to the Great Sea. And I don’t remember any moon, either new or old, in Caras Galadhon: only stars by night and sun by day.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Legolas stirred in his boat. ‘Nay, time does not tarry ever,’ he said; ‘but change and growth is not in all things and places&#13;
         alike. For the Elves the world moves, and it moves both very swift and very slow. Swift, because they themselves change little,&#13;
         and all else fleets by: it is a grief to them. Slow, because they need not count the running years, not for themselves. The&#13;
         passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream. Yet beneath the Sun all things must wear to an end&#13;
         at last.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But the wearing is slow in Lórien,’ said Frodo. ‘The power of the Lady is on it. Rich are the hours, though short they seem,&#13;
         in Caras Galadhon, where Galadriel wields the Elven-ring.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page507"/>&#13;
      <p>‘That should not have been said outside Lórien, not even to me,’ said Aragorn. ‘Speak no more of it! But so it is, Sam: in&#13;
         that land you lost your count. There time flowed swiftly by us, as for the Elves. The old moon passed, and a new moon waxed&#13;
         and waned in the world outside, while we tarried there. And yestereve a new moon came again. Winter is nearly gone. Time flows&#13;
         on to a spring of little hope.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The night passed silently. No voice or call was heard again across the water. The travellers huddled in their boats felt the&#13;
         changing of the weather. The air grew warm and very still under the great moist clouds that had floated up from the South&#13;
         and the distant seas. The rushing of the River over the rocks of the rapids seemed to grow louder and closer. The twigs of&#13;
         the trees above them began to drip.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When the day came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sad. Slowly the dawn grew to a pale light, diffused&#13;
         and shadowless. There was mist on the River, and white fog swathed the shore; the far bank could not be seen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I can’t abide fog,’ said Sam; ‘but this seems to be a lucky one. Now perhaps we can get away without those cursed goblins&#13;
         seeing us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Perhaps so,’ said Aragorn. ‘But it will be hard to find the path unless the fog lifts a little later on. And we must find&#13;
         the path, if we are to pass Sarn Gebir and come to the Emyn Muil.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not see why we should pass the Rapids or follow the River any further,’ said Boromir. ‘If the Emyn Muil lie before us,&#13;
         then we can abandon these cockle-boats, and strike westward and southward, until we come to the Entwash and cross into my&#13;
         own land.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We can, if we are making for Minas Tirith,’ said Aragorn, ‘but that is not yet agreed. And such a course may be more perilous&#13;
         than it sounds. The vale of Entwash is flat and fenny, and fog is a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden. I would&#13;
         not abandon our boats until we must. The River is at least a path that cannot be missed.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page508"/>&#13;
      <p>‘But the Enemy holds the eastern bank,’ objected Boromir. ‘And even if you pass the Gates of Argonath and come unmolested&#13;
         to the Tindrock, what will you do then? Leap down the Falls and land in the marshes?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No!’ answered Aragorn. ‘Say rather that we will bear our boats by the ancient way to Rauros-foot, and there take to the water&#13;
         again. Do you not know, Boromir, or do you choose to forget the North Stair, and the high seat upon Amon Hen, that were made&#13;
         in the days of the great kings? I at least have a mind to stand in that high place again, before I decide my further course.&#13;
         There, maybe, we shall see some sign that will guide us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir held out long against this choice; but when it became plain that Frodo would follow Aragorn, wherever he went, he&#13;
         gave in. ‘It is not the way of the Men of Minas Tirith to desert their friends at need,’ he said, ‘and you will need my strength,&#13;
         if ever you are to reach the Tindrock. To the tall isle I will go, but no further. There I shall turn to my home, alone if&#13;
         my help has not earned the reward of any companionship.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The day was now growing, and the fog had lifted a little. It was decided that Aragorn and Legolas should at once go forward&#13;
         along the shore, while the others remained by the boats. Aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their&#13;
         boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the Rapids.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Boats of the Elves would not sink, maybe,’ he said, ‘but that does not say that we should come through Sarn Gebir alive.&#13;
         None have ever done so yet. No road was made by the Men of Gondor in this region, for even in their great days their realm&#13;
         did not reach up Anduin beyond the Emyn Muil; but there is a portage-way somewhere on the western shore, if I can find it.&#13;
         It cannot yet have perished; for light boats used to journey out of Wilderland down to Osgiliath, and still did so until a&#13;
         few years ago, when the Orcs of Mordor began to multiply.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page509"/>&#13;
      <p>‘Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the North, and the Orcs prowl on the east-shore,’ said Boromir. ‘If you go forward,&#13;
         peril will grow with every mile, even if you find a path.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Peril lies ahead on every southward road,’ answered Aragorn. ‘Wait for us one day. If we do not return in that time, you&#13;
         will know that evil has indeed befallen us. Then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you can.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>It was with a heavy heart that Frodo saw Aragorn and Legolas climb the steep bank and vanish into the mists; but his fears&#13;
         proved groundless. Only two or three hours had passed, and it was barely mid-day, when the shadowy shapes of the explorers&#13;
         appeared again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘All is well,’ said Aragorn, as he clambered down the bank. ‘There is a track, and it leads to a good landing that is still&#13;
         serviceable. The distance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half a mile below us, and they are little more than&#13;
         a mile long. Not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly. Our hardest task will&#13;
         be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage-way. We have found it, but it lies well back from the water-side here,&#13;
         and runs under the lee of a rock-wall, a furlong or more from the shore. We did not find where the northward landing lies.&#13;
         If it still remains, we must have passed it yesterday night. We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog. I fear&#13;
         we must leave the River now, and make for the portage-way as best we can from here.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That would not be easy, even if we were all Men,’ said Boromir.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yet such as we are we will try it,’ said Aragorn.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Aye, we will,’ said Gimli. ‘The legs of Men will lag on a rough road, while a Dwarf goes on, be the burden twice his own&#13;
         weight, Master Boromir!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. The goods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the&#13;
         bank, where there was a level space. Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up. They were &#13;
         <a id="page510"/>far less heavy than any had expected. Of what tree growing in the Elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; but&#13;
         the wood was tough and yet strangely light. Merry and Pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat. Nonetheless&#13;
         it needed the strength of the two Men to lift and haul them over the ground that the Company now had to cross. It sloped up&#13;
         away from the River, a tumbled waste of grey limestone-boulders, with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes; there&#13;
         were thickets of brambles, and sheer dells; and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the terraces further&#13;
         inland.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>One by one Boromir and Aragorn carried the boats, while the others toiled and scrambled after them with the baggage. At last&#13;
         all was removed and laid on the portage-way. Then with little further hindrance, save from sprawling briars and many fallen&#13;
         stones, they moved forward all together. Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock-wall, and to their left mist shrouded&#13;
         the River: they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir, but they could not&#13;
         see it. Twice they made the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern landing.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There the portage-way, turning back to the water-side, ran gently down to the shallow edge of a little pool. It seemed to&#13;
         have been scooped in the river-side, not by hand, but by the water swirling down from Sarn Gebir against a low pier of rock&#13;
         that jutted out some way into the stream. Beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey cliff, and there was no further passage&#13;
         for those on foot.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Already the short afternoon was past, and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in. They sat beside the water listening to the confused&#13;
         rush and roar of the Rapids hidden in the mist; they were tired and sleepy, and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,’ said Boromir. ‘We need sleep, and even if Aragorn had a mind to&#13;
         pass the Gates of Argonath by night, we are all too tired – except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page511"/>&#13;
      <p>Gimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Let us rest as much as we can now,’ said Aragorn. ‘Tomorrow we must journey by day again. Unless the weather changes once&#13;
         more and cheats us, we shall have a good chance of slipping through, unseen by any eyes on the eastern shore. But tonight&#13;
         two must watch together in turns: three hours off and one on guard.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour before dawn. As soon as it was fully light they started.&#13;
         Already the fog was thinning. They kept as close as they could to the western side, and they could see the dim shapes of the&#13;
         low cliffs rising ever higher, shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying river. In the mid-morning the clouds drew down&#13;
         lower, and it began to rain heavily. They drew the skin-covers over their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and drifted&#13;
         on; little could be seen before them or about them through the grey falling curtains.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The rain, however, did not last long. Slowly the sky above grew lighter, and then suddenly the clouds broke, and their draggled&#13;
         fringes trailed away northward up the River. The fogs and mists were gone. Before the travellers lay a wide ravine, with great&#13;
         rocky sides to which clung, upon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. The channel grew narrower and the River&#13;
         swifter. Now they were speeding along with little hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them was&#13;
         a lane of pale-blue sky, around them the dark overshadowed River, and before them black, shutting out the sun, the hills of&#13;
         Emyn Muil, in which no opening could be seen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo peering forward saw in the distance two great rocks approaching: like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed.&#13;
         Tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream. A narrow gap appeared between them, and the River swept&#13;
         the boats towards it.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Behold the Argonath, the Pillars of the Kings!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We shall pass them soon. Keep the boats in line, &#13;
         <a id="page512"/>and as far apart as you can! Hold the middle of the stream!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>As Frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet him. Giants they seemed to him, vast grey figures&#13;
         silent but threatening. Then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned: the craft and power of old had wrought upon&#13;
         them, and still they preserved through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had been&#13;
         hewn. Upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone: still with blurred eyes and crannied&#13;
         brows they frowned upon the North. The left hand of each was raised palm outwards in gesture of warning; in each right hand&#13;
         there was an axe; upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown. Great power and majesty they still wore, the silent&#13;
         wardens of a long-vanished kingdom. Awe and fear fell upon Frodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to&#13;
         look up as the boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by, frail and fleeting as little leaves, under&#13;
         the enduring shadow of the sentinels of Númenor. So they passed into the dark chasm of the Gates.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side. Far off was the dim sky. The black waters roared and echoed,&#13;
         and a wind screamed over them. Frodo crouching over his knees heard Sam in front muttering and groaning: ‘What a place! What&#13;
         a horrible place! Just let me get out of this boat, and I’ll never wet my toes in a puddle again, let alone a river!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Fear not!’ said a strange voice behind him. Frodo turned and saw Strider, and yet not Strider; for the weatherworn Ranger&#13;
         was no longer there. In the stern sat Aragorn son of Arathorn, proud and erect, guiding the boat with skilful strokes; his&#13;
         hood was cast back, and his dark hair was blowing in the wind, a light was in his eyes: a king returning from exile to his&#13;
         own land.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Fear not!’ he said. ‘Long have I desired to look upon the likenesses of Isildur and Anárion, my sires of old. Under their&#13;
         shadow Elessar, the Elfstone son of Arathorn of the House &#13;
         <a id="page513"/>of Valandil Isildur’s son, heir of Elendil, has naught to dread!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Then the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: ‘Would that Gandalf were here! How my heart yearns for Minas Anor&#13;
         and the walls of my own city! But whither now shall I go?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of wind and rushing water and echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards&#13;
         the west so that at first all was dark ahead; but soon Frodo saw a tall gap of light before him, ever growing. Swiftly it&#13;
         drew near, and suddenly the boats shot through, out into a wide clear light.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky. The pent waters spread out into a long oval lake,&#13;
         pale Nen Hithoel, fenced by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, but their heads were bare, cold-gleaming in&#13;
         the sunlight. At the far southern end rose three peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered from&#13;
         them, an island in the waters, about which the flowing River flung pale shimmering arms. Distant but deep there came up on&#13;
         the wind a roaring sound like the roll of thunder heard far away.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Behold Tol Brandir!’ said Aragorn, pointing south to the tall peak. ‘Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw, and upon the right is&#13;
         Amon Hen, the Hills of Hearing and of Sight. In the days of the great kings there were high seats upon them, and watch was&#13;
         kept there. But it is said that no foot of man or beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere the shade of night falls we&#13;
         shall come to them. I hear the endless voice of Rauros calling.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The Company rested now for a while, drifting south on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake. They ate some&#13;
         food, and then they took to their paddles and hastened on their way. The sides of the westward hills fell into shadow, and&#13;
         the Sun grew round and red. Here and there a misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed before them, darkling in the twilight.&#13;
         Rauros was roaring with a great &#13;
         <a id="page514"/>voice. Already night was laid on the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the hills.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>The tenth day of their journey was over. Wilderland was behind them. They could go no further without choice between the east-way&#13;
         and the west. The last stage of the Quest was before them.&#13;
      </p>&#13;

      <p class="cotx">Aragorn led them to the right arm of the River. Here upon its western side under the shadow of Tol Brandir a green lawn ran&#13;
         down to the water from the feet of Amon Hen. Behind it rose the first gentle slopes of the hill clad with trees, and trees&#13;
         marched away westward along the curving shores of the lake. A little spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here we will rest tonight,’ said Aragorn. ‘This is the lawn of Parth Galen: a fair place in the summer days of old. Let us&#13;
         hope that no evil has yet come here.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>They drew up their boats on the green banks, and beside them they made their camp. They set a watch, but had no sight nor&#13;
         sound of their enemies. If Gollum had contrived to follow them, he remained unseen and unheard. Nonetheless as the night wore&#13;
         on Aragorn grew uneasy, tossing often in his sleep and waking. In the small hours he got up and came to Frodo, whose turn&#13;
         it was to watch.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Why are you waking?’ asked Frodo. ‘It is not your watch.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not know,’ answered Aragorn; ‘but a shadow and a threat has been growing in my sleep. It would be well to draw your&#13;
         sword.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Why?’ said Frodo. ‘Are enemies at hand?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Let us see what Sting may show,’ answered Aragorn.</p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay the edges gleamed dimly in the night. ‘Orcs!’ he said. ‘Not very&#13;
         near, and yet too near, it seems.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I feared as much,’ said Aragorn. ‘But maybe they are not on this side of the River. The light of Sting is faint, and it may&#13;
         point to no more than spies of Mordor roaming on the slopes of Amon Lhaw. I have never heard before of Orcs &#13;
         <a id="page516"/>upon Amon Hen. Yet who knows what may happen in these evil days, now that Minas Tirith no longer holds secure the passages&#13;
         of Anduin. We must go warily tomorrow.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The day came like fire and smoke. Low in the East there were black bars of cloud like the fumes of a great burning. The rising&#13;
         sun lit them from beneath with flames of murky red; but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky. The summit of Tol Brandir&#13;
         was tipped with gold. Frodo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island. Its sides sprang sheer out of the running water.&#13;
         High up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed, mounting one head above another; and above them&#13;
         again were grey faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by a great spire of stone. Many birds were circling about it, but no sign&#13;
         of other living things could be seen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>When they had eaten, Aragorn called the Company together. ‘The day has come at last,’ he said: ‘the day of choice which we&#13;
         have long delayed. What shall now become of our Company that has travelled so far in fellowship? Shall we turn west with Boromir&#13;
         and go to the wars of Gondor; or turn east to the Fear and Shadow; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and that&#13;
         as each may choose? Whatever we do must be done soon. We cannot long halt here. The enemy is on the eastern shore, we know;&#13;
         but I fear that the Orcs may already be on this side of the water.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>There was a long silence in which no one spoke or moved.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, Frodo,’ said Aragorn at last. ‘I fear that the burden is laid upon you. You are the Bearer appointed by the Council.&#13;
         Your own way you alone can choose. In this matter I cannot advise you. I am not Gandalf, and though I have tried to bear his&#13;
         part, I do not know what design or hope he had for this hour, if indeed he had any. Most likely it seems that if he were here&#13;
         now the choice would still wait on you. Such is your fate.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. ‘I know that haste is needed, yet I cannot choose. The burden &#13;
         <a id="page517"/>is heavy. Give me an hour longer, and I will speak. Let me be alone!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Aragorn looked at him with kindly pity. ‘Very well, Frodo son of Drogo,’ he said. ‘You shall have an hour, and you shall be&#13;
         alone. We will stay here for a while. But do not stray far or out of call.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed. Sam, who had been watching his master with great concern, shook his head and muttered:&#13;
         ‘Plain as a pikestaff it is, but it’s no good Sam Gamgee putting in his spoke just now.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Presently Frodo got up and walked away; and Sam saw that while the others restrained themselves and did not stare at him,&#13;
         the eyes of Boromir followed Frodo intently, until he passed out of sight in the trees at the foot of Amon Hen.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Wandering aimlessly at first in the wood, Frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill. He&#13;
         came to a path, the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago. In steep places stairs of stone had been hewn, but now they were&#13;
         cracked and worn, and split by the roots of trees. For some while he climbed, not caring which way he went, until he came&#13;
         to a grassy place. Rowan-trees grew about it, and in the midst was a wide flat stone. The little upland lawn was open upon&#13;
         the East and was filled now with the early sunlight. Frodo halted and looked out over the River, far below him, to Tol Brandir&#13;
         and the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle. The voice of Rauros was a mighty roaring&#13;
         mingled with a deep throbbing boom.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands, staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes. All that had&#13;
         happened since Bilbo left the Shire was passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember&#13;
         of Gandalf ’s words. Time went on, and still he was no nearer to a choice.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that something was behind him, that unfriendly eyes were&#13;
         upon him. He sprang up and turned; but all that &#13;
         <a id="page518"/>he saw to his surprise was Boromir, and his face was smiling and kind.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I was afraid for you, Frodo,’ he said, coming forward. ‘If Aragorn is right and Orcs are near, then none of us should wander&#13;
         alone, and you least of all: so much depends on you. And my heart too is heavy. May I stay now and talk for a while, since&#13;
         I have found you? It would comfort me. Where there are so many, all speech becomes a debate without end. But two together&#13;
         may perhaps find wisdom.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘You are kind,’ answered Frodo. ‘But I do not think that any speech will help me. For I know what I should do, but I am afraid&#13;
         of doing it, Boromir: afraid.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir stood silent. Rauros roared endlessly on. The wind murmured in the branches of the trees. Frodo shivered.</p>&#13;
      <p>Suddenly Boromir came and sat beside him. ‘Are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly?’ he said. ‘I wish to help you.&#13;
         You need counsel in your hard choice. Will you not take mine?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I think I know already what counsel you would give, Boromir,’ said Frodo. ‘And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning&#13;
         of my heart.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Warning? Warning against what?’ said Boromir sharply.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Against delay. Against the way that seems easier. Against refusal of the burden that is laid on me. Against – well, if it&#13;
         must be said, against trust in the strength and truth of Men.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little country, though you knew it not.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I do not doubt the valour of your people. But the world is changing. The walls of Minas Tirith may be strong, but they are&#13;
         not strong enough. If they fail, what then?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We shall fall in battle valiantly. Yet there is still hope that they will not fail.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘No hope while the Ring lasts,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Ah! The Ring!’ said Boromir, his eyes lighting. ‘The Ring! Is it not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and&#13;
         doubt for so small a thing? So small a thing! And I have seen it only for an instant in the house of Elrond. Could I not have&#13;
         a sight of it again?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page519"/>&#13;
      <p>Frodo looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught the strange gleam in Boromir’s eyes, yet his face was still kind&#13;
         and friendly. ‘It is best that it should lie hidden,’ he answered.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘As you wish. I care not,’ said Boromir. ‘Yet may I not even speak of it? For you seem ever to think only of its power in&#13;
         the hands of the Enemy: of its evil uses not of its good. The world is changing, you say. Minas Tirith will fall, if the Ring&#13;
         lasts. But why? Certainly, if the Ring were with the Enemy. But why, if it were with us?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Were you not at the Council?’ answered Frodo. ‘Because we cannot use it, and what is done with it turns to evil.’</p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir got up and walked about impatiently. ‘So you go on,’ he cried. ‘Gandalf, Elrond – all these folk have taught you to&#13;
         say so. For themselves they may be right. These elves and half-elves and wizards, they would come to grief perhaps. Yet often&#13;
         I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid. But each to his own kind. True-hearted Men, they will not be corrupted. We&#13;
         of Minas Tirith have been staunch through long years of trial. We do not desire the power of wizard-lords, only strength to&#13;
         defend ourselves, strength in a just cause. And behold! in our need chance brings to light the Ring of Power. It is a gift,&#13;
         I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor. It is mad not to use it, to use the power of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the&#13;
         ruthless, these alone will achieve victory. What could not a warrior do in this hour, a great leader? What could not Aragorn&#13;
         do? Or if he refuses, why not Boromir? The Ring would give me power of Command. How I would drive the hosts of Mordor, and&#13;
         all men would flock to my banner!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly. Almost he seemed to have forgotten Frodo, while his talk dwelt on walls&#13;
         and weapons, and the mustering of men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious victories to be; and he cast down&#13;
         Mordor, and became himself a mighty king, benevolent and wise. Suddenly he stopped and waved his arms.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And they tell us to throw it away!’ he cried. ‘I do not say <a id="page520"/><em>destroy</em> it. That might be well, if reason could show any hope of doing so. It does not. The only plan that is proposed to us is that&#13;
         a halfling should walk blindly into Mordor and offer the Enemy every chance of recapturing it for himself. Folly!&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Surely you see it, my friend?’ he said, turning now suddenly to Frodo again. ‘You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the&#13;
         boldest should pardon you. But is it not really your good sense that revolts?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No, I am afraid,’ said Frodo. ‘Simply afraid. But I am glad to have heard you speak so fully. My mind is clearer now.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Then you will come to Minas Tirith?’ cried Boromir. His eyes were shining and his face eager.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘You misunderstand me,’ said Frodo.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘But you will come, at least for a while?’ Boromir persisted. ‘My city is not far now; and it is little further from there&#13;
         to Mordor than from here. We have been long in the wilderness, and you need news of what the Enemy is doing before you make&#13;
         a move. Come with me, Frodo,’ he said. ‘You need rest before your venture, if go you must.’ He laid his hand on the hobbit’s&#13;
         shoulder in friendly fashion; but Frodo felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement. He stepped quickly away, and eyed&#13;
         with alarm the tall Man, nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Why are you so unfriendly?’ said Boromir. ‘I am a true man, neither thief nor tracker. I need your Ring: that you know now;&#13;
         but I give you my word that I do not desire to keep it. Will you not at least let me make trial of my plan? Lend me the Ring!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘No! no!’ cried Frodo. ‘The Council laid it upon me to bear it.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It is by our own folly that the Enemy will defeat us,’ cried Boromir. ‘How it angers me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully&#13;
         to death and ruining our cause. If any mortals have claim to the Ring, it is the men of Númenor, and not Halflings. It is&#13;
         not yours save by unhappy chance. It might have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <a id="page521"/>&#13;
      <p>Frodo did not answer, but moved away till the great flat stone stood between them. ‘Come, come, my friend!’ said Boromir in&#13;
         a softer voice. ‘Why not get rid of it? Why not be free of your doubt and fear? You can lay the blame on me, if you will.&#13;
         You can say that I was too strong and took it by force. For I am too strong for you, halfling,’ he cried; and suddenly he&#13;
         sprang over the stone and leaped at Frodo. His fair and pleasant face was hideously changed; a raging fire was in his eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them. There was only one thing he could do: trembling he pulled out the&#13;
         Ring upon its chain and quickly slipped it on his finger, even as Boromir sprang at him again. The Man gasped, stared for&#13;
         a moment amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking here and there among the rocks and trees.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Miserable trickster!’ he shouted. ‘Let me get my hands on you! Now I see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron and&#13;
         sell us all. You have only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch. Curse you and all halflings to death and darkness!’&#13;
         Then, catching his foot on a stone, he fell sprawling and lay upon his face. For a while he was as still as if his own curse&#13;
         had struck him down; then suddenly he wept.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears. ‘What have I said?’ he cried. ‘What have I done? Frodo,&#13;
         Frodo!’ he called. ‘Come back! A madness took me, but it has passed. Come back!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">There was no answer. Frodo did not even hear his cries. He was already far away, leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top.&#13;
         Terror and grief shook him, seeing in his thought the mad fierce face of Boromir, and his burning eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Soon he came out alone on the summit of Amon Hen, and halted, gasping for breath. He saw as through a mist a wide flat circle,&#13;
         paved with mighty flags, and surrounded with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set upon four carven pillars, was&#13;
         a high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. Up he went and sat upon the ancient chair, feeling like &#13;
         <a id="page522"/>a lost child that had clambered upon the throne of mountain-kings.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At first he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were only shadows: the Ring was upon him.&#13;
         Then here and there the mist gave way and he saw many visions: small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table,&#13;
         and yet remote. There was no sound, only bright living images. The world seemed to have shrunk and fallen silent. He was sitting&#13;
         upon the Seat of Seeing, on Amon Hen, the Hill of the Eye of the Men of Númenor. Eastward he looked into wide uncharted lands,&#13;
         nameless plains, and forests unexplored. Northward he looked, and the Great River lay like a ribbon beneath him, and the Misty&#13;
         Mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth. Westward he looked and saw the broad pastures of Rohan; and Orthanc, the pinnacle&#13;
         of Isengard, like a black spike. Southward he looked, and below his very feet the Great River curled like a toppling wave&#13;
         and plunged over the falls of Rauros into a foaming pit; a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume. And Ethir Anduin he saw,&#13;
         the mighty delta of the River, and myriads of sea-birds whirling like a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green and&#13;
         silver sea, rippling in endless lines.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>But everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The Misty Mountains were crawling like anthills: orcs were issuing out of&#13;
         a thousand holes. Under the boughs of Mirkwood there was deadly strife of Elves and Men and fell beasts. The land of the Beornings&#13;
         was aflame; a cloud was over Moria; smoke rose on the borders of Lórien.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Horsemen were galloping on the grass of Rohan; wolves poured from Isengard. From the havens of Harad ships of war put out&#13;
         to sea; and out of the East Men were moving endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon horses, chariots of chieftains and&#13;
         laden wains. All the power of the Dark Lord was in motion. Then turning south again he beheld Minas Tirith. Far away it seemed,&#13;
         and beautiful: white-walled, many-towered, proud and fair upon its mountain-seat; its &#13;
         <a id="page523"/>battlements glittered with steel, and its turrets were bright with many banners. Hope leaped in his heart. But against Minas&#13;
         Tirith was set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither, eastward, unwilling his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined&#13;
         bridges of Osgiliath, the grinning gates of Minas Morgul, and the haunted Mountains, and it looked upon Gorgoroth, the valley&#13;
         of terror in the Land of Mordor. Darkness lay there under the Sun. Fire glowed amid the smoke. Mount Doom was burning, and&#13;
         a great reek rising. Then at last his gaze was held: wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably strong,&#13;
         mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: Barad-dûr, Fortress of Sauron. All hope left him.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>And suddenly he felt the Eye. There was an eye in the Dark Tower that did not sleep. He knew that it had become aware of his&#13;
         gaze. A fierce eager will was there. It leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it, searching for him. Very soon&#13;
         it would nail him down, know just exactly where he was. Amon Lhaw it touched. It glanced upon Tol Brandir – he threw himself&#13;
         from the seat, crouching, covering his head with his grey hood.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He heard himself crying out: <em>Never, never!</em> Or was it: <em>Verily I come, I come to you</em>? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point of power there came to his mind another thought: <em>Take it off! Take it off! Fool, take it off! Take off the Ring!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>The two powers strove in him. For a moment, perfectly balanced between their piercing points, he writhed, tormented. Suddenly&#13;
         he was aware of himself again, Frodo, neither the Voice nor the Eye: free to choose, and with one remaining instant in which&#13;
         to do so. He took the Ring off his finger. He was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat. A black shadow seemed to&#13;
         pass like an arm above him; it missed Amon Hen and groped out west, and faded. Then all the sky was clean and blue and birds&#13;
         sang in every tree.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo rose to his feet. A great weariness was on him, but his will was firm and his heart lighter. He spoke aloud to &#13;
         <a id="page524"/>himself. ‘I will do now what I must,’ he said. ‘This at least is plain: the evil of the Ring is already at work even in the&#13;
         Company, and the Ring must leave them before it does more harm. I will go alone. Some I cannot trust, and those I can trust&#13;
         are too dear to me: poor old Sam, and Merry and Pippin. Strider, too: his heart yearns for Minas Tirith, and he will be needed&#13;
         there, now Boromir has fallen into evil. I will go alone. At once.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>He went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where Boromir had found him. Then he halted, listening. He thought&#13;
         he could hear cries and calls from the woods near the shore below.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘They’ll be hunting for me,’ he said. ‘I wonder how long I have been away. Hours, I should think.’ He hesitated. ‘What can&#13;
         I do?’ he muttered. ‘I must go now or I shall never go. I shan’t get a chance again. I hate leaving them, and like this without&#13;
         any explanation. But surely they will understand. Sam will. And what else can I do?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Slowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more. He vanished and passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the wind.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">The others remained long by the river-side. For some time they had been silent, moving restlessly about; but now they were&#13;
         sitting in a circle, and they were talking. Every now and again they made efforts to speak of other things, of their long&#13;
         road and many adventures; they questioned Aragorn concerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history, and the remnants&#13;
         of its great works that could still be seen in this strange border-land of the Emyn Muil: the stone kings and the seats of&#13;
         Lhaw and Hen, and the great Stair beside the falls of Rauros. But always their thoughts and words strayed back to Frodo and&#13;
         the Ring. What would Frodo choose to do? Why was he hesitating?&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘He is debating which course is the most desperate, I think,’ said Aragorn. ‘And well he may. It is now more hopeless than&#13;
         ever for the Company to go east, since we have been tracked &#13;
         <a id="page525"/>by Gollum, and must fear that the secret of our journey is already betrayed. But Minas Tirith is no nearer to the Fire and&#13;
         the destruction of the Burden.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the Lord Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do what even&#13;
         Elrond said was beyond his power: either to keep the Burden secret, or to hold off the full might of the Enemy when he comes&#13;
         to take it. Which way would any of us choose in Frodo’s place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss Gandalf most.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Grievous is our loss,’ said Legolas. ‘Yet we must needs make up our minds without his aid. Why cannot we decide, and so help&#13;
         Frodo? Let us call him back and then vote! I should vote for Minas Tirith.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And so should I,’ said Gimli. ‘We, of course, were only sent to help the Bearer along the road, to go no further than we&#13;
         wished; and none of us is under any oath or command to seek Mount Doom. Hard was my parting from Lothlórien. Yet I have come&#13;
         so far, and I say this: now we have reached the last choice, it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo. I would choose Minas&#13;
         Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘And I too will go with him,’ said Legolas. ‘It would be faithless now to say farewell.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,’ said Aragorn. ‘But if he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor&#13;
         do I think that all should. That venture is desperate: as much so for eight as for three or two, or one alone. If you would&#13;
         let me choose, then I should appoint three companions: Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli; and myself. Boromir&#13;
         will return to his own city, where his father and his people need him; and with him the others should go, or at least Meriadoc&#13;
         and Peregrin, if Legolas is not willing to leave us.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘That won’t do at all!’ cried Merry. ‘We can’t leave Frodo! Pippin and I always intended to go wherever he went, and we still&#13;
         do. But we did not realize what that would mean. It &#13;
         <a id="page526"/>seemed different so far away, in the Shire or in Rivendell. It would be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor. Why can’t&#13;
         we stop him?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We must stop him,’ said Pippin. ‘And that is what he is worrying about, I am sure. He knows we shan’t agree to his going&#13;
         east. And he doesn’t like to ask anyone to go with him, poor old fellow. Imagine it: going off to Mordor alone!’ Pippin shuddered.&#13;
         ‘But the dear silly old hobbit, he ought to know that he hasn’t got to ask. He ought to know that if we can’t stop him, we&#13;
         shan’t leave him.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Begging your pardon,’ said Sam. ‘I don’t think you understand my master at all. He isn’t hesitating about which way to go.&#13;
         Of course not! What’s the good of Minas Tirith anyway? To him, I mean, begging your pardon, Master Boromir,’ he added, and&#13;
         turned. It was then that they discovered that Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle,&#13;
         was no longer there.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now where’s he got to?’ cried Sam, looking worried. ‘He’s been a bit queer lately, to my mind. But anyway he’s not in this&#13;
         business. He’s off to his home, as he always said; and no blame to him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows he’s got to find the Cracks&#13;
         of Doom, if he can. But he’s <em>afraid</em>. Now it’s come to the point, he’s just plain terrified. That’s what his trouble is. Of course he’s had a bit of schooling,&#13;
         so to speak – we all have – since we left home, or he’d be so terrified he’d just fling the Ring in the River and bolt. But&#13;
         he’s still too frightened to start. And he isn’t worrying about us either: whether we’ll go along with him or no. He knows&#13;
         we mean to. That’s another thing that’s bothering him. If he screws himself up to go, he’ll want to go alone. Mark my words!&#13;
         We’re going to have trouble when he comes back. For he’ll screw himself up all right, as sure as his name’s Baggins.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘I believe you speak more wisely than any of us, Sam,’ said Aragorn. ‘And what shall we do, if you prove right?’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Stop him! Don’t let him go!’ cried Pippin.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I wonder?’ said Aragorn. ‘He is the Bearer, and the fate of the Burden is on him. I do not think that it is our part to &#13;
         <a id="page527"/>drive him one way or the other. Nor do I think that we should succeed, if we tried. There are other powers at work far stronger.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Well, I wish Frodo would “screw himself up” and come back, and let us get it over,’ said Pippin. ‘This waiting is horrible!&#13;
         Surely the time is up?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ said Aragorn. ‘The hour is long passed. The morning is wearing away. We must call for him.’</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">At that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from the trees and walked towards them without speaking. His face looked grim&#13;
         and sad. He paused as if counting those that were present, and then sat down aloof, with his eyes on the ground.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Where have you been, Boromir?’ asked Aragorn. ‘Have you seen Frodo?’</p>&#13;
      <p>Boromir hesitated for a second. ‘Yes, and no,’ he answered slowly. ‘Yes: I found him some way up the hill, and I spoke to&#13;
         him. I urged him to come to Minas Tirith and not to go east. I grew angry and he left me. He vanished. I have never seen such&#13;
         a thing happen before, though I have heard of it in tales. He must have put the Ring on. I could not find him again. I thought&#13;
         he would return to you.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Is that all that you have to say?’ said Aragorn, looking hard and not too kindly at Boromir.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yes,’ he answered. ‘I will say no more yet.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘This is bad!’ cried Sam, jumping up. ‘I don’t know what this Man has been up to. Why should Mr. Frodo put the thing on? He&#13;
         didn’t ought to have; and if he has, goodness knows what may have happened!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘But he wouldn’t keep it on,’ said Merry. ‘Not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘But where did he go? Where is he?’ cried Pippin. ‘He’s been away ages now.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir?’ asked Aragorn.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Half an hour, maybe,’ he answered. ‘Or it might be an &#13;
         <a id="page528"/>hour. I have wandered for some time since. I do not know! I do not know!’ He put his head in his hands, and sat as if bowed&#13;
         with grief.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘An hour since he vanished!’ shouted Sam. ‘We must try and find him at once. Come on!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Wait a moment!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We must divide up into pairs, and arrange – here, hold on! Wait!’</p>&#13;
      <p>It was no good. They took no notice of him. Sam had dashed off first. Merry and Pippin had followed, and were already disappearing&#13;
         westward into the trees by the shore, shouting: <em>Frodo! Frodo!</em> in their clear, high, hobbit-voices. Legolas and Gimli were running. A sudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on the&#13;
         Company.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘We shall all be scattered and lost,’ groaned Aragorn. ‘Boromir! I do not know what part you have played in this mischief,&#13;
         but help now! Go after those two young hobbits, and guard them at the least, even if you cannot find Frodo. Come back to this&#13;
         spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. I shall return soon.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">Aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam. Just as he reached the little lawn among the rowans he overtook him,&#13;
         toiling uphill, panting and calling, <em>Frodo!</em></p>&#13;
      <p>‘Come with me, Sam!’ he said. ‘None of us should be alone. There is mischief about. I feel it. I am going to the top, to the&#13;
         Seat of Amon Hen, to see what may be seen. And look! It is as my heart guessed, Frodo went this way. Follow me, and keep your&#13;
         eyes open!’ He sped up the path.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam did his best, but he could not keep up with Strider the Ranger, and soon fell behind. He had not gone far before Aragorn&#13;
         was out of sight ahead. Sam stopped and puffed. Suddenly he clapped his hand to his head.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Whoa, Sam Gamgee!’ he said aloud. ‘Your legs are too short, so use your head! Let me see now! Boromir isn’t lying, that’s&#13;
         not his way; but he hasn’t told us everything. Something scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed himself up to the point, sudden.&#13;
         He made up his mind at last – to go. Where &#13;
         <a id="page529"/>to? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam. That’s hard, cruel hard.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears. ‘Steady, Gamgee!’ he said. ‘Think, if you can! He can’t fly across&#13;
         rivers, and he can’t jump waterfalls. He’s got no gear. So he’s got to get back to the boats. Back to the boats! Back to the&#13;
         boats, Sam, like lightning!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Sam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up he got and ran on. He came to the edge of the lawn&#13;
         of Parth Galen by the shore, where the boats were drawn up out of the water. No one was there. There seemed to be cries in&#13;
         the woods behind, but he did not heed them. He stood gazing for a moment, stock-still, gaping. A boat was sliding down the&#13;
         bank all by itself. With a shout Sam raced across the grass. The boat slipped into the water.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Coming, Mr. Frodo! Coming!’ called Sam, and flung himself from the bank, clutching at the departing boat. He missed it by&#13;
         a yard. With a cry and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water. Gurgling he went under, and the River closed&#13;
         over his curly head.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and the boat put about. Frodo was just in time to grasp&#13;
         Sam by the hair as he came up, bubbling and struggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Up you come, Sam my lad!’ said Frodo. ‘Now take my hand!’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Save me, Mr. Frodo!’ gasped Sam. ‘I’m drownded. I can’t see your hand.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Here it is. Don’t pinch, lad! I won’t let you go. Tread water and don’t flounder, or you’ll upset the boat. There now, get&#13;
         hold of the side, and let me use the paddle!’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>With a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the bank, and Sam was able to scramble out, wet as a water-rat. Frodo took&#13;
         off the Ring and stepped ashore again.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam!’ he said.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Oh, Mr. Frodo, that’s hard!’ said Sam shivering. ‘That’s &#13;
         <a id="page530"/>hard, trying to go without me and all. If I hadn’t a guessed right, where would you be now?’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Safely on my way.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Safely!’ said Sam. ‘All alone and without me to help you? I couldn’t have a borne it, it’d have been the death of me.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘It would be the death of you to come with me, Sam,’ said Frodo, ‘and I could not have borne that.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Not as certain as being left behind,’ said Sam.</p>&#13;
      <p>‘But I am going to Mordor.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I’m coming with you.’</p>&#13;
      <p>‘Now, Sam,’ said Frodo, ‘don’t hinder me! The others will be coming back at any minute. If they catch me here, I shall have&#13;
         to argue and explain, and I shall never have the heart or the chance to get off. But I must go at once. It’s the only way.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Of course it is,’ answered Sam. ‘But not alone. I’m coming too, or neither of us isn’t going. I’ll knock holes in all the&#13;
         boats first.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>Frodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart. ‘Leave one!’ he said. ‘We’ll need it. But you can’t&#13;
         come like this without your gear or food or anything.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Just hold on a moment, and I’ll get my stuff!’ cried Sam eagerly. ‘It’s all ready. I thought we should be off today.’ He&#13;
         rushed to the camping place, fished out his pack from the pile where Frodo had laid it when he emptied the boat of his companions’&#13;
         goods, grabbed a spare blanket, and some extra packages of food, and ran back.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘So all my plan is spoilt!’ said Frodo. ‘It is no good trying to escape you. But I’m glad, Sam. I cannot tell you how glad.&#13;
         Come along! It is plain that we were meant to go together. We will go, and may the others find a safe road! Strider will look&#13;
         after them. I don’t suppose we shall see them again.’&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>‘Yet we may, Mr. Frodo. We may,’ said Sam.</p>&#13;
      <p class="spb">So Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest together. Frodo paddled away from the shore, and the River &#13;
         <a id="page531"/>bore them swiftly away, down the western arm, and past the frowning cliffs of Tol Brandir. The roar of the great falls drew&#13;
         nearer. Even with such help as Sam could give, it was hard work to pass across the current at the southward end of the island&#13;
         and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore.&#13;
      </p>&#13;
      <p>At length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of Amon Lhaw. There they found a shelving shore, and they drew&#13;
         the boat out, high above the water, and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulder. Then shouldering their burdens,&#13;
         they set off, seeking a path that would bring them over the grey hills of the Emyn Muil, and down into the Land of Shadow.&#13;
