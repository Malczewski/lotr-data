CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter I
CHAPTER_NAME,AN UNEXPECTED PARTY
TEXT_CONTEXT,"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."
TEXT_POEM,Chip the glasses and crack the plates!
TEXT_POEM,Blunt the knives and bend the forks!
TEXT_POEM,That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates–
TEXT_POEM,Smash the bottles and burn the corks!
TEXT_POEM,Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!
TEXT_POEM,Pour the milk on the pantry floor!
TEXT_POEM,Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!
TEXT_POEM,Splash the wine on every door!
TEXT_POEM,Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl;
TEXT_POEM,Pound them up with a thumping pole;
TEXT_POEM,"And when you’ve finished, if any are whole,"
TEXT_POEM,Send them down the hall to roll!
TEXT_POEM,That’s what Bilbo Baggins hates!
TEXT_POEM,"So, carefully! carefully with the plates!"
TEXT_POEM,Far over the misty mountains cold
TEXT_POEM,To dungeons deep and caverns old
TEXT_POEM,We must away ere break of day
TEXT_POEM,To seek the pale enchanted gold.
TEXT_POEM,"The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,"
TEXT_POEM,While hammers fell like ringing bells
TEXT_POEM,"In places deep, where dark things sleep,"
TEXT_POEM,In hollow halls beneath the fells.
TEXT_POEM,For ancient king and elvish lord
TEXT_POEM,There many a gleaming golden hoard
TEXT_POEM,"They shaped and wrought, and light they caught"
TEXT_POEM,To hide in gems on hilt of sword.
TEXT_POEM,On silver necklaces they strung
TEXT_POEM,"The flowering stars, on crowns they hung"
TEXT_POEM,"The dragon-fire, in twisted wire"
TEXT_POEM,They meshed the light of moon and sun.
TEXT_POEM,Far over the misty mountains cold
TEXT_POEM,To dungeons deep and caverns old
TEXT_POEM,"We must away, ere break of day,"
TEXT_POEM,To claim our long-forgotten gold.
TEXT_POEM,Goblets they carved there for themselves
TEXT_POEM,And harps of gold; where no man delves
TEXT_POEM,"There lay they long, and many a song"
TEXT_POEM,Was sung unheard by men or elves.
TEXT_POEM,"The pines were roaring on the height,"
TEXT_POEM,The winds were moaning in the night.
TEXT_POEM,"The fire was red, it flaming spread;"
TEXT_POEM,The trees like torches blazed with light.
TEXT_POEM,The bells were ringing in the dale
TEXT_POEM,And men looked up with faces pale;
TEXT_POEM,The dragon’s ire more fierce than fire
TEXT_POEM,Laid low their towers and houses frail.
TEXT_POEM,The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
TEXT_POEM,"The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom."
TEXT_POEM,They fled their hall to dying fall
TEXT_POEM,"Beneath his feet, beneath the moon."
TEXT_POEM,Far over the misty mountains grim
TEXT_POEM,To dungeons deep and caverns dim
TEXT_POEM,"We must away, ere break of day,"
TEXT_POEM,To win our harps and gold from him!
TEXT_POEM,Far over the misty mountains cold
TEXT_POEM,To dungeons deep and caverns old
TEXT_POEM,"We must away, ere break of day,"
TEXT_POEM,To find our long-forgotten gold.
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter II
CHAPTER_NAME,ROAST MUTTON
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room. There he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used. The washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he was really relieved after all to think that they had all gone without him, and without bothering to wake him up (“but with never a thank-you” he thought); and yet in a way he could not help feeling just a trifle disappointed. The feeling surprised him."
TEXT_STORY,"“Thorin and Company to Burglar Bilbo greeting! For your hospitality our sincerest thanks, and for your offer of professional assistance our grateful acceptance. Terms: cash on delivery, up to and not exceeding one fourteenth of total profits (if any); all travelling expenses guaranteed in any event; funeral expenses to be defrayed by us or our representatives, if occasion arises and the matter is not otherwise arranged for."
TEXT_POEM,“ We have the honour to remain
TEXT_POEM,“ Yours deeply
TEXT_POEM,“ Thorin & Co.”
TEXT_STORY,"“Just when a wizard would have been most useful, too,” groaned Dori and Nori (who shared the hobbit’s views about regular meals, plenty and often)."
UNKNOWN(img1),
UNKNOWN(cap),The Trolls
TEXT_STORY,"It was just then that Gandalf came back. But no one saw him. The trolls had just decided to roast the dwarves now and eat them later—that was Bert’s idea, and after a lot of argument they had all agreed to it."
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter III
CHAPTER_NAME,A SHORT REST
TEXT_CONTEXT,"They did not sing or tell stories that day, even though the weather improved; nor the next day, nor the day after. They had begun to feel that danger was not far away on either side. They camped under the stars, and their horses had more to eat than they had; for there was plenty of grass, but there was not much in their bags, even with what they had got from the trolls. One morning they forded a river at a wide shallow place full of the noise of stones and foam. The far bank was steep and slippery. When they got to the top of it, leading their ponies, they saw that the great mountains had marched down very near to them. Already they seemed only a day’s easy journey from the feet of the nearest. Dark and drear it looked, though there were patches of sunlight on its brown sides, and behind its shoulders the tips of snow-peaks gleamed."
TEXT_STORY,"Now Gandalf led the way. “We must not miss the road, or we shall be done for,” he said. “We need food, for one thing, and rest in reasonable safety—also it is very necessary to tackle the Misty Mountains by the proper path, or else you will get lost in them, and have to come back and start at the beginning again (if you ever get back at all).”"
TEXT_POEM,"O! What are you doing,"
TEXT_POEM,And where are you going?
TEXT_POEM,Your ponies need shoeing!
TEXT_POEM,The river is flowing!
TEXT_POEM,O! tra-la-la-lally
TEXT_POEM,here down in the valley!
TEXT_POEM,"O! What are you seeking,"
TEXT_POEM,And where are you making?
TEXT_POEM,"The faggots are reeking,"
TEXT_POEM,The bannocks are baking!
TEXT_POEM,O! tril-lil-lil-lolly
TEXT_POEM,"the valley is jolly,"
TEXT_POEM,ha! ha!
TEXT_POEM,O! Where are you going
TEXT_POEM,With beards all a-wagging?
TEXT_POEM,"No knowing, no knowing"
TEXT_POEM,What brings Mister Baggins
TEXT_POEM,And Balin and Dwalin
TEXT_POEM,down into the valley
TEXT_POEM,in June
TEXT_POEM,ha! ha!
TEXT_POEM,"O! Will you be staying,"
TEXT_POEM,Or will you be flying?
TEXT_POEM,Your ponies are straying!
TEXT_POEM,The daylight is dying!
TEXT_POEM,"To fly would be folly,"
TEXT_POEM,To stay would be jolly
TEXT_POEM,And listen and hark
TEXT_POEM,Till the end of the dark
TEXT_POEM,to our tune
TEXT_POEM,ha! ha!
TEXT_STORY,"Now it is a strange thing, but things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about, and not much to listen to; while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale, and take a deal of telling anyway. They stayed long in that good house, fourteen days at least, and they found it hard to leave. Bilbo would gladly have stopped there for ever and ever—even supposing a wish would have taken him right back to his hobbit-hole without trouble. Yet there is little to tell about their stay."
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter IV
CHAPTER_NAME,OVER HILL AND UNDER HILL
TEXT_CONTEXT,"There were many paths that led up into those mountains, and many passes over them. But most of the paths were cheats and deceptions and led nowhere or to bad ends; and most of the passes were infested by evil things and dreadful dangers. The dwarves and the hobbit, helped by the wise advice of Elrond and the knowledge and memory of Gandalf, took the right road to the right pass."
TEXT_STORY,"He knew that something unexpected might happen, and he hardly dared to hope that they would pass without fearful adventure over those great tall mountains with lonely peaks and valleys where no king ruled. They did not. All was well, until one day they met a thunderstorm—more than a thunderstorm, a thunder-battle. You know how terrific a really big thunderstorm can be down in the land and in a river-valley; especially at times when two great thunderstorms meet and clash. More terrible still are thunder and lightning in the mountains at night, when storms come up from East and West and make war. The lightning splinters on the peaks, and rocks shiver, and great crashes split the air and go rolling and tumbling into every cave and hollow; and the darkness is filled with overwhelming noise and sudden light."
UNKNOWN(cap),The Mountain-path
TEXT_POEM,Clap! Snap! the black crack!
TEXT_POEM,"Grip, grab! Pinch, nab!"
TEXT_POEM,And down down to Goblin-town
TEXT_POEM,"You go, my lad!"
TEXT_POEM,"Clash, crash! Crush, smash!"
TEXT_POEM,"Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs! Pound, pound, far underground!"
TEXT_POEM,"Ho, ho! my lad!"
TEXT_POEM,"Swish, smack! Whip crack!"
TEXT_POEM,"Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat! Work, work! Nor dare to shirk,"
TEXT_POEM,"While Goblins quaff, and Goblins laugh, Round and round far underground"
TEXT_POEM,"Below, my lad!"
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter V
CHAPTER_NAME,RIDDLES IN THE DARK
TEXT_CONTEXT,"When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as with them shut. No one was anywhere near him. Just imagine his fright! He could hear nothing, see nothing, and he could feel nothing except the stone of the floor."
TEXT_STORY,"Now certainly Bilbo was in what is called a tight place. But you must remember it was not quite so tight for him as it would have been for me or for you. Hobbits are not quite like ordinary people; and after all if their holes are nice cheery places and properly aired, quite different from the tunnels of the goblins, still they are more used to tunnelling than we are, and they do not easily lose their sense of direction underground—not when their heads have recovered from being bumped. Also they can move very quietly, and hide easily, and recover wonderfully from falls and bruises, and they have a fund of wisdom and wise sayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago."
TEXT_POEM,"What has roots as nobody sees,"
TEXT_POEM,"Is taller than trees,"
TEXT_POEM,"Up, up it goes,"
TEXT_POEM,And yet never grows?
TEXT_POEM,"Thirty white horses on a red hill,"
TEXT_POEM,"First they champ,"
TEXT_POEM,"Then they stamp,"
TEXT_POEM,Then they stand still.
TEXT_POEM,"Voiceless it cries,"
TEXT_POEM,"Wingless flutters,"
TEXT_POEM,"Toothless bites,"
TEXT_POEM,Mouthless mutters.
TEXT_POEM,An eye in a blue face
TEXT_POEM,Saw an eye in a green face.
TEXT_POEM,“That eye is like to this eye”
TEXT_POEM,"Said the first eye,"
TEXT_POEM,“But in low place
TEXT_POEM,Not in high place.”
TEXT_POEM,"It cannot be seen, cannot be felt,"
TEXT_POEM,"Cannot be heard, cannot be smelt."
TEXT_POEM,"It lies behind stars and under hills,"
TEXT_POEM,And empty holes it fills.
TEXT_POEM,"It comes first and follows after,"
TEXT_POEM,"Ends life, kills laughter."
TEXT_POEM,"A box without hinges, key, or lid,"
TEXT_POEM,"Yet golden treasure inside is hid,"
TEXT_CONTEXT,"he asked to gain time, until he could think of a really hard one. This he thought a dreadfully easy chestnut, though he had not asked it in the usual words. But it proved a nasty poser for Gollum. He hissed to himself, and still he did not answer; he whispered and spluttered."
TEXT_POEM,"Alive without breath,"
TEXT_POEM,As cold as death;
TEXT_POEM,"Never thirsty, ever drinking,"
TEXT_POEM,All in mail never clinking.
TEXT_POEM,This thing all things devours:
TEXT_POEM,"Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;"
TEXT_POEM,"Gnaws iron, bites steel;"
TEXT_POEM,Grinds hard stones to meal;
TEXT_POEM,"Slays king, ruins town,"
TEXT_POEM,And beats high mountain down.
UNKNOWN(ext_center),“Time! Time!”
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter VI
CHAPTER_NAME,OUT OF THE FRYING-PAN INTO THE FIRE
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Bilbo had escaped the goblins, but he did not know where he was. He had lost hood, cloak, food, pony, his buttons and his friends. He wandered on and on, till the sun began to sink westwards—behind the mountains. Their shadows fell across Bilbo’s path, and he looked back. Then he looked forward and could see before him only ridges and slopes falling towards lowlands and plains glimpsed occasionally between the trees."
TEXT_STORY,"“Must we go any further?” asked Bilbo, when it was so dark that he could only just see Thorin’s beard wagging beside him, and so quiet that he could hear the dwarves’ breathing like a loud noise. “My toes are all bruised and bent, and my legs ache, and my stomach is wagging like an empty sack.”"
TEXT_STORY,"“What is all this uproar in the forest tonight?” said the Lord of the Eagles. He was sitting, black in the moonlight, on the top of a lonely pinnacle of rock at the eastern edge of the mountains. “I hear wolves’ voices! Are the goblins at mischief in the woods?”"
TEXT_POEM,"Fifteen birds in five fir-trees,"
TEXT_POEM,their feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze!
TEXT_POEM,"But, funny little birds, they had no wings!"
TEXT_POEM,"O what shall we do with the funny little things? Roast ’em alive, or stew them in a pot;"
TEXT_POEM,"fry them, boil them and eat them hot?"
TEXT_POEM,"Burn, burn tree and fern!"
TEXT_POEM,Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch
TEXT_POEM,"To light the night for our delight,"
TEXT_POEM,Ya hey!
TEXT_POEM,"Bake and toast ’em, fry and roast ’em!"
TEXT_POEM,"till beards blaze, and eyes glaze;"
TEXT_POEM,"till hair smells and skins crack,"
TEXT_POEM,"fat melts, and bones black"
TEXT_POEM,in cinders lie
TEXT_POEM,beneath the sky!
TEXT_POEM,"So dwarves shall die,"
TEXT_POEM,"and light the night for our delight,"
TEXT_POEM,Ya hey!
TEXT_POEM,Ya-harri-hey!
TEXT_POEM,Ya hoy!
TEXT_STORY,"There was a howl of anger and surprise from the goblins. Loud cried the Lord of the Eagles, to whom Gandalf had now spoken. Back swept the great birds that were with him, and down they came like huge black shadows. The wolves yammered and gnashed their teeth; the goblins yelled and stamped with rage, and flung their heavy spears in the air in vain. Over them swooped the eagles; the dark rush of their beating wings smote them to the floor or drove them far away; their talons tore at goblin faces. Other birds flew to the tree-tops and seized the dwarves, who were scrambling up now as far as they ever dared to go."
UNKNOWN(cap),The Misty Mountains Looking West from the Eyrie to
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter VII
CHAPTER_NAME,QUEER LODGINGS
TEXT_CONTEXT,"The next morning Bilbo woke up with the early sun in his eyes. He jumped up to look at the time and to go and put his kettle on—and found he was not home at all. So he sat down and wished in vain for a wash and a brush. He did not get either, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for his breakfast, only cold mutton and rabbit. And after that he had to get ready for a fresh start."
TEXT_STORY,"After that they stopped pleading. Then they took off their clothes and bathed in the river, which was shallow and clear and stony at the ford. When they had dried in the sun, which was now strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still sore and a little hungry. Soon they crossed the ford (carrying the hobbit), and then began to march through the long green grass and down the lines of the wide-armed oaks and the tall elms."
TEXT_STORY,"Bilbo and the dwarves had now plenty to think about, and they asked no more questions. They still had a long way to walk before them. Up slope and down dale they plodded. It grew very hot. Sometimes they rested under the trees, and then Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have eaten acorns, if any had been ripe enough yet to have fallen to the ground."
TEXT_STORY,"After a while they came to a belt of tall and very ancient oaks, and beyond these to a high thorn-hedge through which you could neither see nor scramble."
UNKNOWN(img2),
TEXT_STORY,"Inside the hall it was now quite dark. Beorn clapped his hands, and in trotted four beautiful white ponies and several large long-bodied grey dogs. Beorn said something to them in a queer language like animal noises turned into talk. They went out again and soon came back carrying torches in their mouths, which they lit at the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars of the hall about the central hearth. The dogs could stand on their hind-legs when they wished, and carry things with their fore-feet. Quickly they got out boards and trestles from the side walls and set them up near the fire."
TEXT_POEM,"The wind was on the withered heath,"
TEXT_POEM,but in the forest stirred no leaf:
TEXT_POEM,"there shadows lay by night and day,"
TEXT_POEM,and dark things silent crept beneath.
TEXT_POEM,"The wind came down from mountains cold,"
TEXT_POEM,and like a tide it roared and rolled;
TEXT_POEM,"the branches groaned, the forest moaned,"
TEXT_POEM,and leaves were laid upon the mould.
TEXT_POEM,The wind went on from West to East;
TEXT_POEM,"all movement in the forest ceased,"
TEXT_POEM,but shrill and harsh across the marsh
TEXT_POEM,its whistling voices were released.
TEXT_POEM,"The grasses hissed, their tassels bent,"
TEXT_POEM,the reeds were rattling—on it went
TEXT_POEM,o’er shaken pool under heavens cool
TEXT_POEM,where racing clouds were torn and rent.
TEXT_POEM,It passed the lonely Mountain bare
TEXT_POEM,and swept above the dragon’s lair:
TEXT_POEM,there black and dark lay boulders stark
TEXT_POEM,and flying smoke was in the air.
TEXT_POEM,It left the world and took its flight
TEXT_POEM,over the wide seas of the night.
TEXT_POEM,"The moon set sail upon the gale,"
TEXT_POEM,and stars were fanned to leaping light.
TEXT_STORY,"It was full morning when he awoke. One of the dwarves had fallen over him in the shadows where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on to the floor. It was Bofur, and he was grumbling about it, when Bilbo opened his eyes."
TEXT_STORY,"They thanked him, of course, with many bows and sweepings of their hoods and with many an “at your service, O master of the wide wooden halls!” But their spirits sank at his grave words, and they all felt that the adventure was far more dangerous than they had thought, while all the time, even if they passed all the perils of the road, the dragon was waiting at the end."
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter VIII
CHAPTER_NAME,FLIES AND SPIDERS
TEXT_CONTEXT,"They walked in single file. The entrance to the path was like a sort of arch leading into a gloomy tunnel made by two great trees that leant together, too old and strangled with ivy and hung with lichen to bear more than a few blackened leaves. The path itself was narrow and wound in and out among the trunks. Soon the light at the gate was like a little bright hole far behind, and the quiet was so deep that their feet seemed to thump along while all the trees leaned over them and listened."
TEXT_STORY,"That night they ate their very last scraps and crumbs of food; and next morning when they woke the first thing they noticed was that they were still gnawingly hungry, and the next thing was that it was raining and that here and there the drip of it was dropping heavily on the forest floor. That only reminded them that they were also parchingly thirsty, without doing anything to relieve them: you cannot quench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a chance drip to fall on your tongue. The only scrap of comfort there was came unexpectedly from Bombur."
TEXT_STORY,"That was one of his most miserable moments. But he soon made up his mind that it was no good trying to do anything till day came with some little light, and quite useless to go blundering about tiring himself out with no hope of any breakfast to revive him. So he sat himself down with his back to a tree, and not for the last time fell to thinking of his far-distant hobbit-hole with its beautiful pantries. He was deep in thoughts of bacon and eggs and toast and butter when he felt something touch him. Something like a strong sticky string was against his left hand, and when he tried to move he found that his legs were already wrapped in the same stuff, so that when he got up he fell over."
TEXT_STORY,"Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something. He could not get up at the brutes and he had nothing to shoot with; but looking about he saw that in this place there were many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry little watercourse. Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and it did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one that fitted his hand cosily. As a boy he used to practise throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and even birds, got out of his way as quick as lightning if they saw him stoop; and even grownup he had still spent a deal of his time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the wand, bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of the aiming and throwing sort—indeed he could do lots of things, besides blowing smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking, that I haven’t had time to tell you about. There is no time now. While he was picking up stones, the spider had reached Bombur, and soon he would have been dead. At that moment Bilbo threw. The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped senseless off the tree, flop to the ground, with all its legs curled up."
TEXT_POEM,Old fat spider spinning in a tree!
TEXT_POEM,Old fat spider can’t see me!
TEXT_POEM,Attercop! Attercop!
TEXT_POEM,"Won’t you stop,"
TEXT_POEM,Stop your spinning and look for me?
TEXT_POEM,"Old Tomnoddy, all big body,"
TEXT_POEM,Old Tomnoddy can’t spy me!
TEXT_POEM,Attercop! Attercop!
TEXT_POEM,Down you drop!
TEXT_POEM,You’ll never catch me up your tree!
TEXT_POEM,Lazy Lob and crazy Cob
TEXT_POEM,are weaving webs to wind me.
TEXT_POEM,"I am far more sweet than other meat,"
TEXT_POEM,but still they cannot find me!
TEXT_POEM,"Here am I, naughty little fly;"
TEXT_POEM,you are fat and lazy.
TEXT_POEM,"You cannot trap me, though you try,"
TEXT_POEM,in your cobwebs crazy.
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter IX
CHAPTER_NAME,BARRELS OUT OF BOND
TEXT_CONTEXT,"The day after the battle with the spiders Bilbo and the dwarves made one last despairing effort to find a way out before they died of hunger and thirst. They got up and staggered on in the direction which eight out of the thirteen of them guessed to be the one in which the path lay; but they never found out if they were right. Such day as there ever was in the forest was fading once more into the blackness of night, when suddenly out sprang the light of many torches all round them, like hundreds of red stars. Out leaped Wood-elves with their bows and spears and called the dwarves to halt."
UNKNOWN(img1),
UNKNOWN(cap),The Elvenking's Gate.
TEXT_STORY,"Poor Mr. Baggins—it was a weary long time that he lived in that place all alone, and always in hiding, never daring to take off his ring, hardly daring to sleep, even tucked away in the darkest and remotest corners he could find. For something to do he took to wandering about the Elvenking’s palace. Magic shut the gates, but he could sometimes get out, if he was quick. Companies of the Wood-elves, sometimes with the king at their head, would from time to time ride out to hunt, or to other business in the woods and in the lands to the East. Then if Bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just behind them; though it was a dangerous thing to do. More than once he was nearly caught in the doors, as they clashed together when the last elf passed; yet he did not dare to march among them because of his shadow (altogether thin and wobbly as it was in torchlight), or for fear of being bumped into and discovered. And when he did go out, which was not very often, he did no good. He did not wish to desert the dwarves, and indeed he did not know where in the world to go without them. He could not keep up with the hunting elves all the time they were out, so he never discovered the ways out of the wood, and was left to wander miserably in the forest, terrified of losing himself, until a chance came of returning. He was hungry too outside, for he was no hunter; but inside the caves he could pick up a living of some sort by stealing food from store or table when no one was at hand."
TEXT_STORY,"For some time Bilbo sat and thought about this water-gate, and wondered if it could be used for the escape of his friends, and at last he had the desperate beginnings of a plan."
TEXT_STORY,"When he heard this Bilbo was all in a flutter, for he saw that luck was with him and he had a chance at once to try his desperate plan. He followed the two elves, until they entered a small cellar and sat down at a table on which two large flagons were set. Soon they began to drink and laugh merrily. Luck of an unusual kind was with Bilbo then. It must be potent wine to make a wood-elf drowsy; but this wine, it would seem, was the heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion, not meant for his soldiers or his servants, but for the king’s feasts only, and for smaller bowls not for the butler’s great flagons."
TEXT_STORY,"Balin was told off to watch the guard and the butler and give warning if they stirred. The rest went into the adjoining cellar with the trapdoors. There was little time to lose. Before long, as Bilbo knew, some elves were under orders to come down and help the butler get the empty barrels through the doors into the stream. These were in fact already standing in rows in the middle of the floor waiting to be pushed off. Some of them were wine-barrels, and these were not much use, as they could not easily be opened at the end without a deal of noise, nor could they easily be secured again. But among them were several others, which had been used for bringing other stuffs, butter, apples, and all sorts of things, to the king’s palace."

TEXT_STORY,"Out they went under the overhanging branches of the trees on either bank. Bilbo wondered what the dwarves were feeling and whether a lot of water was getting into their tubs. Some of those that bobbed along by him in the gloom seemed pretty low in the water, and he guessed that these had dwarves inside."
TEXT_STORY,"There is no need to tell you much of his adventures that night, for now we are drawing near the end of the eastward journey and coming to the last and greatest adventure, so we must hurry on. Of course helped by his magic ring he got on very well at first, but he was given away in the end by his wet footsteps and the trail of drippings that he left wherever he went or sat; and also he began to snivel, and wherever he tried to hide he was found out by the terrific explosions of his suppressed sneezes. Very soon there was a fine commotion in the village by the riverside; but Bilbo escaped into the woods carrying a loaf and a leather bottle of wine and a pie that did not belong to him. The rest of the night he had to pass wet as he was and far from a fire, but the bottle helped him to do that, and he actually dozed a little on some dry leaves, even though the year was getting late and the air was chilly."
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter X
CHAPTER_NAME,A WARM WELCOME
TEXT_CONTEXT,The day grew lighter and warmer as they floated along. After a while the river rounded a steep shoulder of land that came down upon their left. Under its rocky feet like an inland cliff the deepest stream had flowed lapping and bubbling. Suddenly the cliff fell away. The shores sank. The trees ended. Then Bilbo saw a sight:

TEXT_POEM,"The King beneath the mountains,"

TEXT_STORY,"In the meanwhile the Wood-elves had gone back up the Forest River with their cargoes, and there was great excitement in the king’s palace. I have never heard what happened to the chief of the guards and the butler. Nothing of course was ever said about keys or barrels while the dwarves stayed in Lake-town, and Bilbo was careful never to become invisible. Still, I daresay, more was guessed than was known, though doubtless Mr. Baggins remained a bit of a mystery. In any case the king knew now the dwarves’ errand, or thought he did, and he said to himself:"
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter XI
CHAPTER_NAME,ON THE DOORSTEP
TEXT_CONTEXT,"In two days going they rowed right up the Long Lake and passed out into the River Running, and now they could all see the Lonely Mountain towering grim and tall before them. The stream was strong and their going slow. At the end of the third day, some miles up the river, they drew in to the left or western bank and disembarked. Here they were joined by the horses with other provisions and necessaries and the ponies for their own use that had been sent to meet them. They packed what they could on the ponies and the rest was made into a store under a tent, but none of the men of the town would stay with them even for the night so near the shadow of the Mountain."
TEXT_STORY,"They reached the skirts of the Mountain all the same without meeting any danger or any sign of the Dragon other than the wilderness he had made about his lair. The Mountain lay dark and silent before them and ever higher above them. They made their first camp on the western side of the great southern spur, which ended in a height called Ravenhill. On this there had been an old watch-post; but they dared not climb it yet, it was too exposed."
UNKNOWN(img1),
UNKNOWN(cap),The Front Gate.
TEXT_STORY,"With such gloomy thoughts, followed ever by croaking crows above them, they made their weary way back to the camp. Only in June they had been guests in the fair house of Elrond, and though autumn was now crawling towards winter that pleasant time now seemed years ago. They were alone in the perilous waste without hope of further help. They were at the end of their journey, but as far as ever, it seemed, from the end of their quest. None of them had much spirit left."
TEXT_STORY,"There was excitement in the camp that night. In the morning they prepared to move once more. Only Bofur and Bombur were left behind to guard the ponies and such stores as they had brought with them from the river. The others went down the valley and up the newly found path, and so to the narrow ledge. Along this they could carry no bundles or packs, so narrow and breathless was it, with a fall of a hundred and fifty feet beside them on to sharp rocks below; but each of them took a good coil of rope wound tight about his waist, and so at last without mishap they reached the little grassy bay."
TEXT_STORY,"In the meanwhile some of them explored the ledge beyond the opening and found a path that led higher and higher on to the mountain; but they did not dare to venture very far that way, nor was there much use in it. Out up there a silence reigned, broken by no bird or sound except that of the wind in the crannies of stone. They spoke low and never called or sang, for danger brooded in every rock. The others who were busy with the secret of the door had no more success. They were too eager to trouble about the runes or the moon-letters, but tried without resting to discover where exactly in the smooth face of the rock the door was hidden. They had brought picks and tools of many sorts from Lake-town, and at first they tried to use these. But when they struck the stone the handles splintered and jarred their arms cruelly, and the steel heads broke or bent like lead. Mining work, they saw clearly, was no good against the magic that had shut this door; and they grew terrified, too, of the echoing noise."
TEXT_STORY,"“Tomorrow begins the last week of autumn,” said Thorin one day."
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter XII
CHAPTER_NAME,INSIDE INFORMATION
TEXT_CONTEXT,"For a long time the dwarves stood in the dark before the door and debated, until at last Thorin spoke:"
TEXT_STORY,"The stars were coming out behind him in a pale sky barred with black when the hobbit crept through the enchanted door and stole into the Mountain. It was far easier going than he expected. This was no goblin entrance, or rough wood-elves’ cave. It was a passage made by dwarves, at the height of their wealth and skill: straight as a ruler, smooth-floored and smooth-sided, going with a gentle never-varying slope direct—to some distant end in the blackness below."
TEXT_STORY,"“Now you are in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins,” he said to himself. “You went and put your foot right in it that night of the party, and now you have got to pull it out and pay for it! Dear me, what a fool I was and am!” said the least Tookish part of him. “I have absolutely no use for dragon-guarded treasures, and the whole lot could stay here for ever, if only I could wake up and find this beastly tunnel was my own front-hall at home!”"
TEXT_STORY,"There he lay, a vast red-golden dragon, fast asleep; a thrumming came from his jaws and nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were low in slumber. Beneath him, under all his limbs and his huge coiled tail, and about him on all sides stretching away across the unseen floors, lay countless piles of precious things, gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained in the ruddy light."
TEXT_STORY,"He gazed for what seemed an age, before drawn almost against his will, he stole from the shadow of the doorway, across the floor to the nearest edge of the mounds of treasure. Above him the sleeping dragon lay, a dire menace even in his sleep. He grasped a great two-handled cup, as heavy as he could carry, and cast one fearful eye upwards. Smaug stirred a wing, opened a claw, the rumble of his snoring changed its note."
TEXT_STORY,"The dwarves were still passing the cup from hand to hand and talking delightedly of the recovery of their treasure, when suddenly a vast rumbling woke in the mountain underneath as if it was an old volcano that had made up its mind to start eruptions once again. The door behind them was pulled nearly to, and blocked from closing with a stone, but up the long tunnel came the dreadful echoes, from far down in the depths, of a bellowing and a trampling that made the ground beneath them tremble."
TEXT_STORY,"“Well, thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear your breath. Come along! Help yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!”"
TEXT_STORY,"This of course is the way to talk to dragons, if you don’t want to reveal your proper name (which is wise), and don’t want to infuriate them by a flat refusal (which is also very wise). No dragon can resist the fascination of riddling talk and of wasting time trying to understand it. There was a lot here which Smaug did not understand at all (though I expect you do, since you know all about Bilbo’s adventures to which he was referring), but he thought he understood enough, and he chuckled in his wicked inside."
TEXT_STORY,"Bilbo was now beginning to feel really uncomfortable. Whenever Smaug’s roving eye, seeking for him in the shadows, flashed across him, he trembled, and an unaccountable desire seized hold of him to rush out and reveal himself and tell all the truth to Smaug. In fact he was in grievous danger of coming under the dragon-spell. But plucking up courage he spoke again."
TEXT_STORY,"The afternoon was turning into evening when he came out again and stumbled and fell in a faint on the ‘doorstep’. The dwarves revived him, and doctored his scorches as well as they could; but it was a long time before the hair on the back of his head and his heels grew properly again: it had all been singed and frizzled right down to the skin. In the meanwhile his friends did their best to cheer him up; and they were eager for his story, especially wanting to know why the dragon had made such an awful noise, and how Bilbo had escaped."
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter XIII
CHAPTER_NAME,NOT AT HOME
TEXT_CONTEXT,"In the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness, and utter silence fell about them. Little they ate and little they spoke. They could not count the passing of time; and they scarcely dared to move, for the whisper of their voices echoed and rustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they woke still to darkness and to silence going on unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when they were becoming choked and dazed for want of air, they could bear it no longer. They would almost have welcomed sounds from below of the dragon’s return. In the silence they feared some cunning devilry of his, but they could not sit there for ever."
TEXT_STORY,"The dwarves, of course, were very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the step with a bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them at the end of the tunnel."
TEXT_STORY,"Under the rocky wall to the right there was no path, so on they trudged among the stones on the left side of the river, and the emptiness and desolation soon sobered even Thorin again. The bridge that Balin had spoken of they found long fallen, and most of its stones were now only boulders in the shallow noisy stream; but they forded the water without much difficulty, and found the ancient steps, and climbed the high bank. After going a short way they struck the old road, and before long came to a deep dell sheltered among the rocks; there they rested for a while and had such a breakfast as they could, chiefly cram and water. (If you want to know what cram is, I can only say that I don’t know the recipe; but it is biscuitish, keeps good indefinitely, is supposed to be sustaining, and is certainly not entertaining, being in fact very uninteresting except as a chewing exercise. It was made by the Lake-men for long journeys.)"
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter XIV
CHAPTER_NAME,FIRE AND WATER
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Now if you wish, like the dwarves, to hear news of Smaug, you must go back again to the evening when he smashed the door and flew off in rage, two days before."
TEXT_STORY,"Already men were jumping into the water on every side. Women and children were being huddled into laden boats in the market-pool. Weapons were flung down. There was mourning and weeping, where but a little time ago the old songs of mirth to come had been sung about the dwarves. Now men cursed their names. The Master himself was turning to his great gilded boat, hoping to row away in the confusion and save himself. Soon all the town would be deserted and burned down to the surface of the lake."
TEXT_STORY,"The waxing moon rose higher and higher and the wind grew loud and cold. It twisted the white fog into bending pillars and hurrying clouds and drove it off to the West to scatter in tattered shreds over the marshes before Mirkwood. Then the many boats could be seen dotted dark on the surface of the lake, and down the wind came the voices of the people of Esgaroth lamenting their lost town and goods and ruined houses. But they had really much to be thankful for, had they thought of it, though it could hardly be expected that they should just then: three quarters of the people of the town had at least escaped alive; their woods and fields and pastures and cattle and most of their boats remained undamaged; and the dragon was dead. What that meant they had not yet realized."
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter XV
CHAPTER_NAME,THE GATHERING OF THE CLOUDS
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Now we will return to Bilbo and the dwarves. All night one of them had watched, but when morning came they had not heard or seen any sign of danger. But ever more thickly the birds were gathering. Their companies came flying from the South; and the crows that still lived about the Mountain were wheeling and crying unceasingly above."
TEXT_STORY,"As you have heard some of the events already, you will see that the dwarves still had some days before them. They explored the caverns once more, and found, as they expected, that only the Front Gate remained open; all the other gates (except, of course, the small secret door) had long ago been broken and blocked by Smaug, and no sign of them remained. So now they began to labour hard in fortifying the main entrance, and in making a new path that led from it. Tools were to be found in plenty that the miners and quarriers and builders of old had used; and at such work the dwarves were still very skilled."
TEXT_STORY,There came a night when suddenly there were many lights as of fires and torches away south in Dale before them.
TEXT_POEM,Under the Mountain dark and tall
TEXT_POEM,The King has come unto his hall!
TEXT_POEM,"His foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,"
TEXT_POEM,And ever so his foes shall fall.
TEXT_POEM,"The sword is sharp, the spear is long,"
TEXT_POEM,"The arrow swift, the Gate is strong;"
TEXT_POEM,The heart is bold that looks on gold;
TEXT_POEM,The dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.
TEXT_POEM,"The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,"
TEXT_POEM,While hammers fell like ringing bells
TEXT_POEM,"In places deep, where dark things sleep,"
TEXT_POEM,In hollow halls beneath the fells.
TEXT_POEM,On silver necklaces they strung
TEXT_POEM,"The light of stars, on crowns they hung"
TEXT_POEM,"The dragon-fire, from twisted wire"
TEXT_POEM,The melody of harps they wrung.
TEXT_POEM,The mountain throne once more is freed!
TEXT_POEM,"O! wandering folk, the summons heed! Come haste!"
TEXT_POEM,Come haste! across the waste!

TEXT_POEM,And ever so our foes shall fall!
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter XVI
CHAPTER_NAME,A THIEF IN THE NIGHT
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their time piling and ordering the treasure; and now Thorin spoke of the Arkenstone of Thrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in every corner."
TEXT_STORY,"That is how it came about that some two hours after his escape from the Gate, Bilbo was sitting beside a warm fire in front of a large tent, and there sat too, gazing curiously at him, both the Elvenking and Bard. A hobbit in elvish armour, partly wrapped in an old blanket, was something new to them."
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter XVII
CHAPTER_NAME,THE CLOUDS BURST
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Next day the trumpets rang early in the camp. Soon a single runner was seen hurrying along the narrow path. At a distance he stood and hailed them, asking whether Thorin would now listen to another embassy, since new tidings had come to hand, and matters were changed."
TEXT_STORY,"That day passed and the night. The next day the wind shifted west, and the air was dark and gloomy. The morning was still early when a cry was heard in the camp. Runners came in to report that a host of dwarves had appeared round the eastern spur of the Mountain and was now hastening to Dale. Dain had come. He had hurried on through the night, and so had come upon them sooner than they had expected. Each one of his folk was clad in a hauberk of steel mail that hung to his knees, and his legs were covered with hose of a fine and flexible metal mesh, the secret of whose making was possessed by Dain’s people. The dwarves are exceedingly strong for their height, but most of these were strong even for dwarves. In battle they wielded heavy two-handed mattocks; but each of them had also a short broad sword at his side and a roundshield slung at his back. Their beards were forked and plaited and thrust into their belts. Their caps were of iron and they were shod with iron, and their faces were grim."
TEXT_STORY,"So began a battle that none had expected; and it was called the Battle of Five Armies, and it was very terrible. Upon one side were the Goblins and the Wild Wolves, and upon the other were Elves and Men and Dwarves. This is how it fell out. Ever since the fall of the Great Goblin of the Misty Mountains the hatred of their race for the dwarves had been rekindled to fury. Messengers had passed to and fro between all their cities, colonies and strongholds; for they resolved now to win the dominion of the North. Tidings they had gathered in secret ways; and in all the mountains there was a forging and an arming. Then they marched and gathered by hill and valley, going ever by tunnel or under dark, until around and beneath the great mountain Gundabad of the North, where was their capital, a vast host was assembled ready to sweep down in time of storm unawares"
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter XVIII
CHAPTER_NAME,THE RETURN JOURNEY
TEXT_CONTEXT,"When Bilbo came to himself, he was literally by himself. He was lying on the flat stones of Ravenhill, and no one was near. A cloudless day, but cold, was broad above him. He was shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head burned with fire."
TEXT_STORY,"All that had happened after he was stunned, Bilbo learned later; but it gave him more sorrow than joy, and he was now weary of his adventure. He was aching in his bones for the homeward journey. That, however, was a little delayed, so in the meantime I will tell something of events. The Eagles had long had suspicion of the goblins’ mustering; from their watchfulness the movements in the mountains could not be altogether hid. So they too had gathered in great numbers, under the great Eagle of the Misty Mountains; and at length smelling battle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the nick of time. They it was who dislodged the goblins from the mountain-slopes, casting them over precipices, or driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. It was not long before they had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and men on either side of the valley could come at last to the help of the battle below."
TEXT_STORY,"The elf-host was on the march; and if it was sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for now the northern world would be merrier for many a long day. The dragon was dead, and the goblins overthrown, and their hearts looked forward after winter to a spring of joy."
TEXT_STORY,"He had many hardships and adventures before he got back. The Wild was still the Wild, and there were many other things in it in those days beside goblins; but he was well guided and well guarded—the wizard was with him, and Beorn for much of the way—and he was never in great danger again. Anyway by midwinter Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back, along both edges of the Forest, to the doors of Beorn’s house; and there for a while they both stayed. Yule-tide was warm and merry there; and men came from far and wide to feast at Beorn’s bidding. The goblins of the Misty Mountains were now few and terrified, and hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and the Wargs had vanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear. Beorn indeed became a great chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of taking bear’s shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in heart like Beorn, if less in size and strength. In their day the last goblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the Wild."
CHAPTER_NUMBER,Chapter XIX
CHAPTER_NAME,THE LAST STAGE
TEXT_CONTEXT,"It was on May the First that the two came back at last to the brink of the valley of Rivendell, where stood the Last (or the First) Homely House. Again it was evening, their ponies were tired, especially the one that carried the baggage; and they all felt in need of rest. As they rode down the steep path, Bilbo heard the elves still singing in the trees, as if they had not stopped since he left; and as soon as the riders came down into the lower glades of the wood they burst into a song of much the same kind as before. This is something like it:"
TEXT_POEM,"The dragon is withered,"
TEXT_POEM,His bones are now crumbled;
TEXT_POEM,"His armour is shivered,"
TEXT_POEM,His splendour is humbled!
TEXT_POEM,"Though sword shall be rusted,"
TEXT_POEM,And throne and crown perish
TEXT_POEM,With strength that men trusted
TEXT_POEM,"And wealth that they cherish,"
TEXT_POEM,"Here grass is still growing,"
TEXT_POEM,"And leaves are yet swinging,"
TEXT_POEM,"The white water flowing,"
TEXT_POEM,And elves are yet singing
TEXT_POEM,Come! Tra-la-la-lally!
TEXT_POEM,Come back to the valley!
TEXT_POEM,The stars are far brighter
TEXT_POEM,"Than gems without measure,"
TEXT_POEM,The moon is far whiter
TEXT_POEM,Than silver in treasure;
TEXT_POEM,The fire is more shining
TEXT_POEM,On hearth in the gloaming
TEXT_POEM,"Than gold won by mining,"
TEXT_POEM,So why go a-roaming?
TEXT_POEM,O! Tra-la-la-lally
TEXT_POEM,Come back to the Valley.
TEXT_POEM,"O! Where are you going,"
TEXT_POEM,So late in returning?
TEXT_POEM,"The river is flowing,"
TEXT_POEM,The stars are all burning!
TEXT_POEM,"O! Whither so laden,"
TEXT_POEM,So sad and so dreary?
TEXT_POEM,Here elf and elf-maiden
TEXT_POEM,Now welcome the weary
TEXT_POEM,With Tra-la-la-lally
TEXT_POEM,"Come back to the Valley,"
TEXT_POEM,Tra-la-la-lally
TEXT_POEM,Fa-la-la-lally
TEXT_POEM,Fa-la!
TEXT_POEM,"Sing all ye joyful, now sing all together!"
TEXT_POEM,"The wind’s in the tree-top, the wind’s in the heather;"
TEXT_POEM,"The stars are in blossom, the moon is in flower,"
TEXT_POEM,And bright are the windows of Night in her tower.
TEXT_POEM,"Dance all ye joyful, now dance all together!"
TEXT_POEM,"Soft is the grass, and let foot be like feather!"
TEXT_POEM,"The river is silver, the shadows are fleeting;"
TEXT_POEM,"Merry is May-time, and merry our meeting."
TEXT_POEM,"Sing we now softly, and dreams let us weave him!"
TEXT_POEM,Wind him in slumber and there let us leave him!
TEXT_POEM,The wanderer sleepeth. Now soft be his pillow! Lullaby!
TEXT_POEM,Lullaby! Alder and Willow!
TEXT_POEM,"Sigh no more Pine, till the wind of the morn!"
TEXT_POEM,Fall Moon! Dark be the land!
TEXT_POEM,"Hush! Hush! Oak, Ash, and Thorn!"
TEXT_POEM,"Hushed be all water, till dawn is at hand!"
TEXT_POEM,"Roads go ever ever on,"
TEXT_POEM,"Over rock and under tree,"
TEXT_POEM,"By caves where never sun has shone,"
TEXT_POEM,By streams that never find the sea;
TEXT_POEM,"Over snow by winter sown,"
TEXT_POEM,"And through the merry flowers of June,"
TEXT_POEM,"Over grass and over stone,"
TEXT_POEM,And under mountains in the moon.
TEXT_POEM,Roads go ever ever on
TEXT_POEM,"Under cloud and under star,"
TEXT_POEM,Yet feet that wandering have gone
TEXT_POEM,Turn at last to home afar.
TEXT_POEM,Eyes that fire and sword have seen
TEXT_POEM,And horror in the halls of stone
TEXT_POEM,Look at last on meadows green
TEXT_POEM,And trees and hills they long have known.
TEXT_STORY,"One autumn evening some years afterwards Bilbo was sitting in his study writing his memoirs—he thought of calling them “There and Back Again, a Hobbit’s Holiday”—when there was a ring at the door. It was Gandalf and a dwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin."
