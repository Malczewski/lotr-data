UNKNOWN(fmh),FOREWORD
UNKNOWN(fmsh),FOREWORD
TEXT_EXTRA,"In his essay On Fairy-Stories (1947) my father wrote of books that he read in his childhood, and in the course of this he said:"
TEXT_CONTEXT,"I had very little desire to look for buried treasure or fight pirates, and Treasure Island left me cool. Red Indians were better: there were bows and arrows (I had and have a wholly unsatisfied desire to shoot well with a bow), and strange languages, and glimpses of an archaic mode of life, and above all, forests in such stories. But the land of Merlin and Arthur were better than these, and best of all the nameless North of Sigurd and the Völsungs, and the prince of all dragons. Such lands were pre-eminently desirable."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"I don’t much approve of The Hobbit myself, preferring my own mythology (which is just touched on) with its consistent nomenclature . . . to this rabble of Eddaic-named dwarves out of Völuspá, newfangled hobbits and gollums (invented in an idle hour) and Anglo-Saxon runes."
TEXT_STORY,"These poems stand in a complex relation to their ancient sources; they are in no sense translations. Those sources themselves, various in their nature, present obscurities, contradictions, and enigmas: and the existence of these problems underlay my father’s avowed purpose in writing the ‘New Lays’."
TEXT_STORY,"The sections of this book are each preceded by drawings made by Mr Bill Sanderson. These are derived closely from wood carvings that adorn the wide door-posts of the twelfth century church of Hylestad in the south of Norway, which are now preserved in the Oldsaksamlingen of the University of Oslo."
TEXT_STORY,"It will be seen that there is no reference in this book to the operas of Richard Wagner that are known by the general title of Der Ring des Nibelungen, or The Ring."
UNKNOWN(fmh),INTRODUCTION
UNKNOWN(fmsh),INTRODUCTION
TEXT_EXTRA,"Many years ago my father referred to the words of William Morris concerning what he called ‘the Great Story of the North’, which, he insisted, should be to us ‘what the Tale of Troy was to the Greeks’, and which far in the future ‘should be to those that come after us no less than the Tale of Troy has been to us.’ On this my father observed: ‘How far off and remote sound now the words of William Morris! The Tale of Troy has been falling into oblivion since that time with surprising rapidity. But the Völsungs have not taken its place.’"
UNKNOWN(fmh),INTRODUCTION TO THE ‘ELDER EDDA’
TEXT_EXTRA,"The poetry that goes by this misleading and unfortunate title attracts occasionally from afar people of various sort – philologists, historians, folklorists, and others of that kidney, but also poets, critics, and connoisseurs of new literary sensations. The philologists (in a wide sense) have as usual done most of the work, and their ardour has not more than usual (probably less than in Beowulf ) been diverted from at least intelligent appreciation of the literary value of these documents."
TEXT_STORY,"Let none who listen to the poets of the Elder Edda go away imagining that he has listened to voices of the Primitive Germanic forest, or that in the heroic figures he has looked upon the lineaments of his noble if savage ancestors – such as fought by, with, or against the Romans. I say this with all possible emphasis – and yet so powerful is the notion of hoary and primeval antiquity which clings to the name (quite recent) Elder Edda in popular fancy (so far as popular fancy may be said to play with so remote and unprofitable a theme at all) that, though the tale ought to begin with the seventeenth century and a learned bishop, insensibly I find myself leading off with the Stone Age."
TEXT_STORY,"Yet the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, at the darkest hour, saw a resurrection after Ragnarök, almost as if there were fulfilled in it the words which the Völva [the sibyl who prophesies in the Eddaic poem Völuspá] speaks concerning the rearising of a new earth, and the return of men and gods to find and marvel at the golden pieces in the grass where once were the halls in which the gods had played at chess [see the tenth verse of the poem The Prophecy of the Sibyl given in Appendix B]."
TEXT_STORY,"When the ‘Elder Edda’ is mentioned, we practically mean a single manuscript – no. 2365 4° in the Royal Collection in Copenhagen: now known as the Codex Regius (of the Elder Edda). It contains 29 poems. There are 45 leaves of it left. After leaf 32 a gathering, probably of eight pages, has been lost.* There appear to have been no losses at beginning and end – where losses frequently occur."
TEXT_STORY,"This is all we know about this remarkable survivor of time, fire, and flood. In 1662 King Frederick III of Denmark sent the well-known Thormod Torfæus with an open letter to the celebrated Brynjólfr Sveinsson. Since 1639 Brynjólfr had been bishop of Skálaholt in Iceland, and had been a keen collector of manuscripts. Torfæus was commissioned to get his help in collecting for the king materials for ancient history, and any antiquities, curiosities, or rarities that could be found in Iceland. In 1663 the bishop sent the choicest of his collection to the king. Among these now priceless treasures was the Codex Regius. Where the bishop had found it, or what was its previous history is unknown, except that he had picked it up twenty years earlier: for on the front page he had written his monogram and a date (LL 1643, i.e. Lupus Loricatus = Brynjólfr), just as we should scrawl our name and a date on a new and interesting acquisition from a second-hand bookshop."
TEXT_STORY,"It may be that it was with that characteristic flourish that my father ended this lecture; at any rate (though the manuscript text continues, and soon turns to a consideration of individual poems) it seems a good place to end it here."
TEXT_STORY,"I append here a number of notes and brief statements on various topics that are best treated separately, as follows."

TEXT_EXTRA,§3 The text of the poems
TEXT_EXTRA,§4 The spelling of Norse names
TEXT_EXTRA,§5 The verse-form of the poems
TEXT_EXTRA,§6 Notes on the poems by the author
CHAPTER_NAME,§1 THE ‘PROSE EDDA’ OF SNORRI STURLUSON
TEXT_EXTRA,"The name Edda properly belongs only to a celebrated work by the Icelander Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241). This is a treatise on the distinctive art of Icelandic poetry which in Snorri’s day was dying out: the old metrical rules disregarded, the old mythological knowledge essential to it attacked by a clergy hostile to any survival of heathendom. This book, in its three parts, is a retelling in prose narrative of ancient myths and legends; an account of, and explanation of, the strange diction of the old ‘court poetry’; and exemplification of its verse-forms."
TEXT_CONTEXT,Hvernig skal kenna gull? How shall gold be named?
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Thus: by calling it the Fire of Ægir; the Pine-needles of Glasir; the Hair of Síf; the Head-band of Fulla; Freyja’s Tears; the Drop, or Rain, or Shower of Draupnir [Ódin’s gold ring, from which dropped other rings]; Otter’s Ransom; Forced Payment of the Æsir; . . ."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Following such a list as this, Snorri gave explanations of these locutions."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Hver er sök til þess, at gull er kallat otrgjöld? What is the reason that gold is called Otter’s ransom?"
TEXT_CONTEXT,"It is told that when the Æsir, Ódin and Loki and Hœnir, went out to explore the world they came to a certain river, and they went along the river to a waterfall; and by the waterfall was an otter . . ."
TEXT_STORY,"It remains to add that the celebrity of Snorri’s book in the centuries that followed, and most especially of the Skáldskaparmál, led, before the emergence of the Codex Regius, to the term Edda being widely used to mean, expressly, the technical rules of the old ‘court’ poetry, or ‘Skaldic’ verse. In those days poets complained of the tyranny of Edda, or offered apologies for their lack of proficiency in the art of Edda. In the words of Gudbrand Vigfússon: ‘An untaught poet who called a spade a spade, instead of describing it by a mythological circumlocution, would be scouted as “Eddaless”’ (Eddu-lauss, ‘having no Eddaic art’). Thus the term ‘Eddaic’, as now used, in opposition to ‘Skaldic’, is a perfect reversal of its former meaning."
CHAPTER_NAME,§2 THE SAGA OF THE VÖLSUNGS (Völsunga Saga)
TEXT_EXTRA,"The Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda is a collection of poems of great diversity, composed by poets who lived centuries apart; but it was compiled and ordered with intelligent care. Most of the heroic poems are concerned with the story of the Völsungs and the Niflungs; and these the compiler of the collection arranged, so far as the diverse structure and scope of the individual lays allowed him, in a narrative sequence, adding explanatory passages in prose at the beginning and end of many of the lays, and narrative links in the course of them."
TEXT_STORY,"In this situation, there is an essential aid to the understanding of the Northern legend. This is the Völsunga Saga, written, probably in Iceland, in the thirteenth century, though the oldest manuscript is much later: a prose tale of the fate of the whole Völsung race from the far ancestry of Sigmund, father of Sigurd, and continuing on to the fall of the Niflungs and the death of Atli (Attila) and beyond. It is founded both on Eddaic lays that survive and other sources now lost; and ‘it is solely from the lays that it has used,’ my father said in a lecture, ‘that it derives its power and the attraction that it has for all those who come to it,’ for he did not hold the author’s artistic capacity in high regard."
CHAPTER_NAME,§3 THE TEXT OF THE POEMS
TEXT_EXTRA,"It is at once obvious that the manuscript of the two lays is a fair copy intended to be final, for my father’s handwriting is clear and uniform throughout, with scarcely any corrections made at the time of writing (and of very few of his manuscripts, however ‘final’ in intention, can that be said). While it cannot be shown to be the case, there is at any rate no indication that the two poems were not written out consecutively."
TEXT_STORY,"The final manuscript of the poems did however itself undergo correction at some later time. By a rough count there are some eighty to ninety emendations scattered through the two texts, from changes of a single word to (but rarely) the substitution of several half-lines; some lines are marked for alteration but without any replacement provided."
TEXT_STORY,"There are two notable differences in the presentation of Völsungakviða en nýja and Guðrúnarkviða en nýja in the manuscript. One concerns the actual organization of the poem. The Lay of the Völsungs following the opening section Upphaf (‘Beginning’) is divided into nine sections, to which my father gave titles in Norse without translation, as follows:"
TEXT_EXTRA,"I have retained these titles in the text, but added translations, as above, to those which are not simply proper names. In the Lay of Gudrún, on the other hand, there is no division into sections."
TEXT_EXTRA,Of old was an age when was emptiness
TEXT_EXTRA,(the opening of Upphaf ). But apart from Upphaf the whole of the Lay of the Völsungs is written in long lines (without a metrical space between the halves):
TEXT_EXTRA,Of old was an age when Ódin walked
TEXT_EXTRA,"(the opening of Andvara-gull ). At the top of this page, however, my father wrote in pencil: ‘This should all be written in short line form, which looks better – as in Upphaf .’ I have therefore set out the text of the Lay of the Völsungs in this way."
CHAPTER_NAME,§4 THE SPELLING OF NORSE NAMES
TEXT_EXTRA,"I have thought it best to follow closely my father’s usage in respect of the writing of Norse names in an English context. The most important features, which appear in his manuscript of the poems with great consistency, are these:"
TEXT_STORY,"The only case where I have imposed consistency is that of the name of the god who in Norse is Óðinn. In his lecture notes my father naturally used the Norse form (which I have retained in the text of his lecture on the ‘Elder Edda’, p.22). In the carefully written manuscript of the ‘New Lays’, on the other hand, he ‘anglicized’ it, changing ð to d, but (as generally in all such cases) retaining the acute accent indicating a long vowel. But he used two forms, favouring one or the other in different parts of the Lay of the Völsungs: Ódin and Ódinn. But in section VI, Brynhildr, where the name occurs frequently in the form Ódinn, he wrote (stanza 8) Ódinn bound me, Ódin’s chosen. This is because in the Norse genitive nn changes to ns: Óðins sonr, ‘son of Ódin’."
CHAPTER_NAME,§5 THE VERSE-FORM OF THE POEMS
TEXT_EXTRA,"The metrical form of these Lays was very evidently a primary element in my father’s purpose. As he said in his letters to W.H. Auden, he wrote in ‘the old eight-line fornyrðislag stanza’, and I give here an abbreviated account of its nature."
TEXT_STORY,"The Old English line was composed of two opposed word-groups or ‘halves’. Each half was an example, or variation, of one of six basic patterns."
UNKNOWN(p4),
TEXT_STORY,"A, B, C have equal feet, each containing a lift and dip. D and E have unequal feet: one consists of a single lift, the other has a subordinate stress (marked `) inserted."
TEXT_STORY,"These are the normal patterns of four elements into which Old English words naturally fell, and into which modern English words still fall. They can be found in any passage of prose, ancient or modern. Verse of this kind differs from prose, not in re-arranging words to fit a special rhythm, repeated or varied in successive lines, but in choosing the simpler and more compact word-patterns and clearing away extraneous matter, so that these patterns stand opposed to one another."
TEXT_EXTRA,"These patterns are found also in fornyrðislag, and can be readily identified in my father’s Norse lays: as for example in stanza 45 of the Lay of Gudrún (p.268), lines 2–6:"
UNKNOWN(tab),A
UNKNOWN(tab),D (a)
UNKNOWN(tab),B
UNKNOWN(tab),E
UNKNOWN(tab),C
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the variations on the ‘basic patterns’ (‘overweighting’, ‘extension’, etc.) described in my father’s account there are indeed differences in Old Norse from Old English, tending to greater brevity; but I will enter only into the most radical and important difference between the verse-forms, namely, that all Norse poetry is ‘strophic’, or ‘stanzaic’, that is, composed in strophes or stanzas. This is in the most marked contrast to Old English, where any such arrangements were altogether avoided; and my father wrote of it (see p.7): ‘In Old English breadth, fullness, reflection, elegiac effect, were aimed at. Old Norse aims at seizing a situation, striking a blow that will be remembered, illuminating a moment with a flash of lightning – and tends to concision, weighty packing of the language in sense and form, and gradually to greater regularity of form of verse.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,Old Norse poetry follows precisely the same principles in the matter of ‘alliteration’ as does Old English poetry. Those principles were formulated thus by my father in his account of Old English metre cited earlier.

CHAPTER_NAME,"§6 NOTES ON THE POEMS, BY THE AUTHOR"
TEXT_EXTRA,"Together with the manuscript of the New Lays were placed some small slips of paper on which my father made some interpretative remarks about them. They were written very rapidly in ink or in pencil, and in the case of (iv) in pencil overwritten and added to in ink, clearly at the same time. It seems impossible to put any even relative date on them; a sense of distance and detachment may be artificial."
TEXT_SPECIAL,(i)
TEXT_CONTEXT,"After the mythical introduction and the account of the Hoard, the Lay turns to the Völsung-family, and traces the history of Völsung, Sigmund, and Sigurd. The chief part is the tragedy of Sigurd and Brynhild, which is of interest for itself; but the whole is given unity as a study of the way in which a wilful deed of Loki, the purposeless slaying of Otr, and his ruthless method of extricating Ódin and himself from the peril into which this deed has brought them sets in motion a curse that at the last brings Sigurd to his death."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"The full working of this curse is only hastened by Ódin’s own interventions – to provide Sigurd with horse and weapon fit for his task, and to provide him with a fit bride, the fairest of all Ódin’s Valkyries, Brynhild. (It appears that Ódin purposes through Sigurd to punish the family of Hreidmar (Fáfnir and Regin) for the exaction of the ransom of Otr.) In the story of Sigurd"
TEXT_EXTRA,Here this text breaks off.
TEXT_SPECIAL,(ii)
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Grímhild, wife of Gjúki King of the Burgundians (or Niflungs), is the chief agent of evil, not because of any farsighted plans of wickedness: she is rather an example of that wickedness that looks only to each situation as it occurs, and sticks at nothing to gain from it what seems immediately profitable. She is ‘grey with wisdom’ being a witch in lore and still more skilled in the reading of minds and hearts to use their weaknesses and follies. Her will dominates her daughter Gudrún and her oldest son Gunnar."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Gudrún is a simple maiden, incapable of any great plans for profit or vengeance. She falls in love with Sigurd, and for herself has no further motive. A sensitive but weak character, she is capable of disastrous speech or action under provocation. The occasions of this that are described are her fatal retort to the taunting of Brynhild, which more than anything is the immediate cause of Sigurd’s murder, and in the sequel, the Slaying of the Niflungs, her terrible deeds at the end when driven to madness and despair."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Gunnar is a hot impatient character, dominated by Grímhild. Though not too stupid to perceive prudence, in cases of doubt or difficulty he becomes fey and reckless, turning to violence."
TEXT_SPECIAL,(iii)
TEXT_CONTEXT,"After Sigurd was slain, Brynhild took her own life, and they were both burned on one pyre. Gudrún did not take her own life, but for grief was for a time half-witless. She would not look upon her kinsmen nor upon her mother, and dwelt apart in a house in the woods. There after a while she began to weave in a tapestry the history of the Dragon-hoard and of Sigurd."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Atli son of Budli became king of the Huns, ancient enemies of the Burgundians, who had before slain his father.* His power growing great becomes a threat to Gunnar, who is now king in his father Gjúki’s stead; and as Högni his brother had foretold they miss now the valour of King Sigurd their sworn-brother."
TEXT_SPECIAL,(iv)
TEXT_CONTEXT,"This lay [i.e. Guðrúnarkviða en nýja] is a sequel to the Lay of Sigurd and assumes knowledge of it, though by the device of Gudrún’s tapestry the history of the accursed Hoard and of Sigurd is brought to mind and outlined at the beginning."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"In the former Lay it was told how the dominion of the Gods was from the first threatened with destruction. Ódin, Lord of Gods and Men, begets in the world many mighty men, whom he gathers in Valhöll to be his companions in the Last Battle. One family in especial he singles out, the Völsungs,* all of whom are his chosen warriors, and one, Sigurd son of Sigmund, is to be the chief of all, their leader in the Last Day; for Ódin hopes that by his hand the Serpent shall in the end be slain, and a new world made possible."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"None of the Gods can accomplish this, but only one who has lived on Earth first as a mortal, and died. (This motive of the special function of Sigurd is an invention of the present poet, or an interpretation of the Norse sources in which it is not explicit.)"
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Evil is not, however, to be found only in the ever-watchful host of the Enemies of Gods and Men. It is found also in Ásgard itself in the person of Loki, by whose deeds, wilful, merely mischievous, or wholly malicious, the counsels and hopes of Ódin seem ever turned awry or defeated."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Yet Loki is seen ever walking the world at the left hand of Ódin, who does not rebuke him, nor dismiss him, nor refuse the aid of his cunning. At Ódin’s right hand there walks another figure, a nameless shadow. It would seem that this poet (seeing that the Northern Gods represent but written large the ways of Men in the hostile world) has taken this old legend to symbolize Man’s prudence and wisdom and its ever present accompaniment of folly and malice that defeats it, only to bring forth greater heroism and deeper wisdom; while ever at the right hand walks the shadow that is neither Ódin nor Loki but in some aspect Fate, the real story that must be blended of both. Yet Ódin is master of the Three and the final outcome will resemble rather the hope of Ódin than the malice (shorter sighted) of Loki. Ódin at times gives expression to this, saying that his hope looks out beyond the seeming disasters of this world. Though Ódin’s chosen come all to an evil end or untimely death, that will only make them of greater worth for their ultimate purpose in the Last Battle. On this in many ways mysterious writing see the commentary on the Upphaf of the Lay of the Völsungs, and the commentary on the first section of the poem, Andvari’s Gold, stanza 1."
TEXT_STORY,"In conclusion, this seems a suitable place to refer to remarks of my father’s that bear upon, but have no (at any rate overt) relation to, Guðrúnarkviða en nýja. In his introduction to lectures at Oxford on the Eddaic poem Guðrúnarkviða en forna, the Old Lay of Gudrún, he said that ‘curiously enough’ he was more interested in Gudrún, ‘who is usually slighted, and considered as of secondary interest’, than in Brynhild. By implication, he contrasted the long agony of Gudrún with the irruption of Brynhild, who soon departs, ‘and her passion and death remain only in the background of the tale, a brief and terrible storm beginning in fire and ending in it.’"

Regin dwelt now in the forest and was deemed wise in many other matters than smithwork. Regin egged Sigurd to slay Fáfnir. With the sword Gram and the horse Grani, of which it is here spoken, he accomplished this, though Regin had concealed from him both the great power of Fáfnir and the nature of the hoard that the serpent guarded. Here also are given the dark words of Regin in which the undermeaning is that the real cause of the serpent’s death is Regin, who should therefore have the gold (though this he has promised, at least in large share, to Sigurd); but that Regin should slay the slayer of his brother. Sigurd deeming him only weighed with the thought of his guilt in brother-murder, dismisses his words with scorn. Nor does Sigurd heed the dragon’s words concerning the curse, thinking them merely the device of greed to protect the gold even though its guardian be slain. This indeed was the dragon’s chief purpose in revealing the curse at the hour of his death. Yet that curse began to work swiftly."

CHAPTER_NAME,COMMENTARY on VÖLSUNGAKVIÐA EN NÝJA
TEXT_CONTEXT,The subtitle Sigurðarkviða en mesta means ‘The Longest Lay of Sigurd’: see p.234.
UNKNOWN(fm-1),UPPHAF
TEXT_EXTRA,"This prelude to the Lay of the Völsungs echoes and reflects the most famous poem of the Edda, the Völuspá, in which the Völva, the wise woman or sibyl, recounts the origin of the world, the age of the youthful Gods, and the primeval war; prophesies the Ragnarök, the Doom of the Gods; and after it the renewal of the Earth, rising again out of deep waters (see the third part of my father’s poem The Prophecy of the Sibyl, given in Appendix B at the end of this book)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"I On this stanza see p.246. It echoes the third stanza of the Völuspá; and citing the Norse verse in a lecture my father followed it with this first stanza of the Upphaf, with some differences: ‘shivering waves’, ‘unraised heaven’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"II It is told by Snorri in the Prose Edda that Heimdal (Heimdallr) was the warden or sentinel of the Gods (Æsir), dwelling beside Bifröst (‘the quaking path’), the rainbow bridge between Ásgard, the realm of the Æsir, and Midgard, the world of Men (see note to 12), which he guards against the rock-giants; but at the Ragnarök (the Doom of the Gods) Bifröst will be crossed by the hosts coming from the fiery land of Múspell, and will break beneath them. The red part of the bow is blazing fire. Heimdal’s horn is the Gjallarhorn, whose blast is heard over all the worlds; and he will blow it at the Ragnarök."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The Ash is Yggdrasill, the World Tree, whose branches stretched out over earth and heaven. The Wolf is Fenrir (named in stanza 13), whom the Gods chained; but at the Ragnarök Fenrir will break his chains and devour Ódin."
TEXT_EXTRA,"12 Surt (Surtr): the great demon of fire, at the Ragnarök coming out of Múspell, the land of fire, against the Gods."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The ‘slumbering Serpent’ is Miðsgarðsormr, the Serpent of Midgard, who lay coiled through all the seas encompassing Midgard, the world of Men. The Norse name Miðgarðr corresponds to Old English Middan-geard, Middan-eard, which lie behind the later form Middle-earth."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The ‘shadowy ship’ is Naglfar, made of dead men’s nails."
TEXT_EXTRA,"13 Frey (Freyr): the chief god of fertility, of peace and plenty, in Norway and Sweden; Freyja (stanza 17) was his sister."
TEXT_EXTRA,The ‘deep Dragon’ is the Serpent of Midgard: see note on stanza 12.
CHAPTER_NAME,I ANDVARA-GULL (Andvari’s Gold)
TEXT_EXTRA,"For the story in §I of the Lay of the Völsungs the sources are the Eddaic poem known as Reginsmál, the Lay of Regin, which is indeed less a poem than fragments of old verse pieced together with prose; a passage in Snorri Sturluson’s version of the Völsung legend in the Prose Edda; and the Völsunga Saga. The few verses in Reginsmál that bear on this part of the narrative (dialogue between Loki and Andvari, and between Loki and Hreidmar after the gold had been paid over) are here and there a model for the Lay, but only lines 5–6 in stanza 8 are a translation (Andvari ek heiti, Óinn hét minn faðir)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"1 Of all the Northern divinities Loki is the most enigmatic; ancient Norse literature is full of references to him and stories about him, and it is not possible to characterize him in a short space. But since Loki only appears here in these poems, and in my father’s words concerning him given on p.54, it seems both suitable and sufficient to quote Snorri Sturluson’s description in the Prose Edda:"
TEXT_CONTEXT,"‘Also counted among the Æsir is Loki, whom some call the mischief-maker of the Æsir, the first father of lies, and the blemish of all gods and men. Loki is handsome and fair of face but evil in his disposition and fickle in his conduct. He excels all others in that cleverness which is called cunning, and he has wiles for every circumstance. Over and over again he has brought the gods into great trouble, but often got them out of it by his guile.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"In this stanza he is called ‘lightfooted Loki’, and in Snorri’s version of the story of Andvari’s Gold it is said, as already noted, that after the payment of the ransom to Hreidmar Ódin took up his spear ‘and Loki his shoes’. Elsewhere Snorri wrote of ‘those shoes with which Loki ran through air and over water’."
TEXT_EXTRA,6 Ásgard is the realm of the Gods (Æsir).
TEXT_EXTRA,7 Rán: the wife of the sea-god Ægir; see p.189.
TEXT_EXTRA,8 ‘I bid thee’: I offer thee.
TEXT_EXTRA,"13–15 In these concluding stanzas the references to the hope of Ódin, and Ódin’s choice, have of course no counterparts in the Norse texts."
CHAPTER_NAME,II SIGNÝ
TEXT_EXTRA,"This is a rendering in verse of elements of the narrative of the earlier chapters of the Völsunga Saga. No old poetry recounting or referring to this story exists apart from a single half-stanza (see the note to stanzas 37–39), but this section of the Lay of the Völsungs can be seen as an imagination of it. It is a selection of moments of dramatic force, and many elements of the prose Saga are omitted; in particular the most savage features of the story are eliminated (see notes to stanzas 30–32, 37–39)."
TEXT_EXTRA,1–2 These two stanzas are an extreme reduction of the opening chapters of the Saga which tell of Völsung’s immediate ancestry in a prosaic fashion: my father clearly found this unsuited to his purpose.
TEXT_EXTRA,2 ‘child of longing’: Rerir’s wife was for long barren.
TEXT_EXTRA,"4 In the Saga the tree in the midst of King Völsung’s hall is named the Barnstock, and is said to have been an apple-tree."
TEXT_EXTRA,"7 ‘Birds sang blithely’: the birds were sitting in the boughs of the great tree that upheld the hall; so again in stanza 11, and see III.2."
TEXT_EXTRA,10 King Siggeir and many other guests came to the wedding feast held in King Völsung’s hall.
TEXT_EXTRA,"12–13 In the Saga the old man is described in terms that make it plain that he was Ódin, but he is not named. Here in the Lay he is Grímnir ‘the Masked’, a name of Ódin that does not appear at all in the Saga but is derived from the Eddaic poem Grímnismál."
TEXT_EXTRA,"14 ‘Gaut and Völsung’: Völsung’s children and race are often called Völsungar, Völsungs, as in the name of the Saga, and in the head-note to this section."
TEXT_EXTRA,"16 This was the beginning of hatred and the motive for Siggeir’s attack on Völsung and his sons when they came to Gautland as his guests (21–23); Siggeir was enraged at Sigmund’s answer, but (in the words of the Saga) ‘he was a very wily man, and he behaved as if he were indifferent’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"17–22 It is told in the Saga that on the day following the night of the wedding feast (‘last night I lay / where loath me was’, 19) Siggeir left very abruptly and returned with Signý to Gautland, having invited Völsung and his sons to come as his guests to Gautland three months later (21). Signý met them when they landed to warn them of what Siggeir had prepared for them (22), but (according to the Saga) Völsung would not listen to Signý’s entreaty that he return at once to his own land, nor to her request that she should be allowed to stay with her own people and not return to Siggeir."
TEXT_EXTRA,20 ‘toft’: homestead.
TEXT_EXTRA,"29 In the Saga the sons of Völsung were set in stocks in the forest to await the old she-wolf who came each night. Signý, on the tenth day, sent her trusted servant to Sigmund, who alone survived, to smear honey over his face and to put some in his mouth. When the wolf came she licked his face and thrust her tongue into his mouth; at which he bit into it. Then the wolf started back violently, pressing her feet against the stocks in which Sigmund was set, so that they were split open; but he held on to the wolf’s tongue so that it was torn out by the roots, and she died. ‘Some men say,’ according to the Saga, ‘that the wolf was King Siggeir’s mother, who had changed herself into this shape by witchcraft.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"While in the Saga the stocks are an important element in the story at this point, in the Lay there is no suggestion of stocks, but only of fetters and shackles; the wolf is ‘torn and tongueless’, but ‘by the tree riven’. See the note on stanzas 30-32."
TEXT_EXTRA,"30–32 This passage is very greatly condensed, and elements in the Saga essential to the narrative are passed over. Thus in the Saga, Signý found Sigmund in the woods, and it is explicit that they decided that he should make a house for himself under the ground, where Signý would provide for his needs. There is nothing in the Saga to explain Signý’s words in the Lay ‘Dwarvish master, thy doors open!’ In the opening prose passage of this section (p.72) it is said that ‘Sigmund dwelt in a cave in the guise of a dwarvish smith.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"In this connection it is curious, if nothing more, to observe that in William Morris’ poem The Story of Sigurd the Volsung Sigmund’s dwelling is explicitly ‘a stony cave’ that was once ‘a house of the Dwarfs’. It is also said in that poem (see the note to stanza 29) that by Siggeir’s orders the men who led the sons of Völsung into the forest cut down the greatest oak-tree that they could find and bound them to it ‘with bonds of iron’; and when the wolf came for Sigmund he ‘burst his bonds’ and slew it with his hands."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Signý had two sons by Siggeir, and when the elder was ten years old she sent him out to Sigmund in the forest to be a help to him should he attempt to avenge Völsung; but the boy, told by Sigmund to make the bread while he himself went out for firewood, was frightened to touch the bag of flour because there was something alive in it. When Sigmund told Signý about this she told him to kill the boy, since he had no heart; and Sigmund did so. The next year Signý sent her second son by Siggeir out into the woods, and things went in the same way."
TEXT_EXTRA,"After that Signý changed shapes with a sorceress, and the sorceress slept with Siggeir for three nights in Signý’s form, while Signý slept with her brother. The son born to them was named Sinfjötli."
TEXT_EXTRA,33 On lines 5–6 of this stanza see the note to 35–36.
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘bast’: flexible bark, used for making baskets, and for tying."
TEXT_EXTRA,"33–34 In the Saga Sigmund subjected Sinfjötli to the same test as Siggeir’s sons, and when he came back to the underground house Sinfjötli had baked the bread, but he said that he thought that there had been something alive in the flour when he started kneading it. Sigmund laughed, and said that Sinfjötli should not eat the bread he had baked, ‘for you have kneaded in a great venomous snake.’ There is no mention in the Saga of Sinfjötli’s bringing Sigmund’s sword (see note to 37–39)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"35–36 A long passage is devoted in the Saga to the ferocious exploits of Sigmund and Sinfjötli in the forest, where they became werewolves; and it is an important point that Sigmund thought that Sinfjötli was the son of Signý and Siggeir (cf. 33 ‘Fair one, thy father / thy face gave not’), possessing the energy and daring of the Völsungs but the evil heart of his father."
TEXT_EXTRA,"37–39 In the Saga Sigmund and Sinfjötli entered Siggeir’s hall and hid themselves behind ale barrels in the outer room; but the two young children of Siggeir and Signý were playing with golden toys, bowling them across the floor of the hall and running along with them, and a gold ring rolled into the room where Sigmund and Sinfjötli sat. One of the children, chasing the ring, ‘saw where two tall, grim men were sitting, with overhanging helms and shining mailcoats’; and he ran back and told his father."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Signý, hearing this, took the children into the outer room and urged Sigmund and Sinfjötli to kill them, since they had betrayed their hiding-place. Sigmund said that he would not kill her children even if they had given him away, but the terrible Sinfjötli made light of it, slew both children, and hurled their bodies into the hall. When Sigmund and Sinfjötli had at last been captured Siggeir had a great burial-mound made of stones and turf; and in the midst of the mound there was set a huge stone slab so that when they were put into it they were separated and could not pass the slab, but could hear each other. But before the mound was covered over Signý threw down a bundle of straw to Sinfjötli, in which was meat. In the darkness of the mound Sinfjötli discovered that Sigmund’s sword was thrust into the meat, and with the sword they were able to saw through the stone slab."

TEXT_EXTRA,"‘They cut with strength the great slab, Sigmund and Sinfjötli, with the sword’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"When they got out of the mound it was night, and everyone was asleep; and bringing up wood they set fire to the hall."
TEXT_EXTRA,"40–41 It was now, when Sigmund told Signý to come forth, that in the Saga she revealed the truth about Sinfjötli – this is no doubt implied in stanza 41 of the Lay, ‘Son Sinfjötli, Sigmund father!’ In her last words, according to the Saga, before she went back into the fire, she declared that she had worked so mightily to achieve vengeance for Völsung that it was impossible for her now to live longer."
CHAPTER_NAME,III DAUÐI SINFJÖTLA (The Death of Sinfjötli)
TEXT_EXTRA,"There intervenes now in the Saga, after the deaths of Signý and Siggeir, the history of Helgi Hundingsbani, an originally independent figure who had been connected to the Völsung legend by making him the son of Sigmund and Borghild (only referred to as ‘the Queen’ in this section of the Lay). In this the Saga follows the ‘Helgi lays’ of the Edda; but in his poem my father entirely eliminated this accretion, and Helgi is not mentioned."
TEXT_EXTRA,"1–2 In the Saga Sigmund, returning to his own land, drove out a usurper who had established himself there."
TEXT_EXTRA,3 ‘Grímnir’s gift’: see II.12–13 and note.
TEXT_EXTRA,"4 In Frá dauða Sinfjötla and in the Saga Sigmund’s queen is named Borghild; in the Lay she is given no name (perhaps because my father regarded the name Borghild as not original in the legend, but entering with the ‘Helgi’ connection). It is not said in the sources that she was taken in war."
TEXT_EXTRA,"6 In both sources Sinfjötli slew Borghild’s brother, not her father; they were suitors for the same woman. In the Saga it is told that Borghild wished to have Sinfjötli driven out of the land, and though Sigmund would not allow this he offered her great riches in atonement; it was at the funeral-feast for her brother that Sinfjötli was murdered."
TEXT_EXTRA,"7 It is told in the Saga, at the time of the bread-making incident, when Sinfjötli kneaded in a poisonous snake (see note to II.33–34), that Sigmund could not be harmed by poison within or without, whereas Sinfjötli could only withstand poison externally; the same is said in Frá dauða Sinfjötla and in the Prose Edda."
TEXT_EXTRA,"9–10 In both sources Sigmund said to Sinfjötli, when Borghild offered him drink for the third time: Láttu grön sía, sonr (‘Strain it through your beard, my son’). Sigmund was very drunk by then, says the Saga, ‘and that is why he said it’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"12 The boatman was Ódin (the verses describing him here are repeated in varied form in IV.8). This is not said in the old sources. In those texts the boatman offered to ferry Sigmund across the fjord, but the boat was too small to take both Sigmund and the body of Sinfjötli, so the body was taken first. Sigmund walked along the fjord, but the boat vanished. The Saga tells that Borghild was banished, and died not long after."
TEXT_EXTRA,13 in Valhöllu: the Norse dative inflexion is retained for metrical reasons.
CHAPTER_NAME,IV FŒDDR SIGURÐR (Sigurd born)
TEXT_EXTRA,"After the expulsion of Borghild Sigmund took another wife very much younger than himself (IV.2), and she was the mother of Sigurd. In the Saga and in Fra dauða Sinfjötla her name was Hjördis, the daughter of King Eylimi; whereas in the Lay she is Sigrlinn. This difference depends on the view that a transference of names took place: that originally in the Norse legends Hjördis was the mother of Helgi (see the note to III), while Sigrlinn was Sigmund’s wife and Sigurd’s mother. After this transference Sigrlinn became the mother of Helgi (and so appears in the Eddaic poem Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar, the Lay of Helgi son of Hjörvarð) and Hjördis became the mother of Sigurd. In the German poem Nibelungenlied, written about the beginning of the thirteenth century, Sieglind (Sigrlinn) was King Siegmund’s queen, the mother of Siegfried (Sigurd)."
TEXT_EXTRA,11 ‘wanhope’: despair.
TEXT_EXTRA,"13 In the Saga Sigmund named the sword that should be made from the shards Gramr; this appears in the next section of the Lay, V.18."
CHAPTER_NAME,V REGIN
TEXT_EXTRA,"The sources of the story in this section of the Lay are not only the Völsunga Saga but also poems of the Edda on which the Saga drew: the conclusion of Reginsmál (see the note to section I, p.188), and Fáfnismál; the story is also briefly told by Snorri Sturluson in the Prose Edda, whereby he explains why ‘gold’ is called in poetry ‘the abode of Fáfnir’ and ‘Grani’s burden’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"14 Gnitaheiði: this name in Old Norse is Gnitaheiðr, of which the second element is Old Norse heiðr ‘heath’, and it is variously anglicized as ‘Gnitaheid’, ‘Gnitaheith’, or ‘Gnitaheath’. In my father’s poems it appears several times but always in the combination ‘on Gnitaheiði’. This may be a retention of the dative case, or it may be a use of the modern Icelandic form of the word, which is heiði."
TEXT_EXTRA,"17–18 It was Sigurd who broke the two swords by striking them on an anvil; whereupon, according to the Saga, he went to his mother and asked whether it were true that Sigmund had entrusted to her the fragments of his sword, and she gave them to him. On the name Gram (Gramr) see the note to IV.13."
TEXT_EXTRA,20 Both Snorri Sturluson and the Saga know of Sigurd’s testing of the sharpness of Gram by its cutting of the tuft of wool when it drifted in the water onto the sword’s edge; but only in the Lay is the river called the Rhine (Rín in Norse).
TEXT_EXTRA,21 ‘Now rede me’: Now give me counsel.
TEXT_EXTRA,"22–24 Only in the Saga is this story found of how Sigurd came to possess his grey horse Grani (very frequently named in poems of the Edda). The old man is once again Ódin (with the description here compare II.12, III.12, IV.8)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The name Busiltarn is derived from the Saga; the Norse form is Busiltjörn, which was the form first written by my father in the manuscript of the Lay, later corrected in pencil. The English word tarn, a small lake, is derived from the Norse word; but in the Saga the Busiltarn is said to be a river, as it clearly is also in the Lay."
TEXT_EXTRA,Sleipnir was the name of Ódin’s eight-legged horse.
TEXT_EXTRA,"25 Gand: Regin’s horse is not named elsewhere, but this must be the Old Norse word gandr (contained in ‘Gandalf’). Its original or primary meaning is uncertain, but it has reference to sorcery and magic, both beings and things, and especially to the staff used in witchcraft; it is also use of wolves. The word gandreið is used of the witches’ nocturnal ride."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In a lecture on the text of Fáfnismál my father remarked on the huge height of the cliff from which Fáfnir drank as a good detail in the Saga absent from the poem, since Sigurd thus ‘first got a notion of what he was in for.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"26 ‘long there lurked he’: i.e. Sigurd. In the prose preamble to Fáfnismál in the Codex Regius, as also in the Saga and in Snorri Sturluson’s brief account, Sigurd dug a pit in the path which the dragon took when he crawled to the water (the ‘hollow’ of stanzas 26–27, 29, which is not said to have been made by Sigurd); in the Saga an old man (Ódin) came to Sigurd while he was digging it and advised him to dig other trenches to carry off the dragon’s blood. On this matter my father noted in a lecture:"
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Ódin and his advice, however, do not appear very intelligible, and the intrusion of Ódin has perhaps been imitated from other places (e.g. the choosing of Grani). The several pits do not seem of much use, for in any case Sigurd has got to be in one, and it is only in the one in which he is (immediately under the wound) that the blood is likely to pour down. The Saga version is due to harping on Ódin, and to an appreciation that the inherited plot did not paint Sigurd’s dragon-slaying (which is later referred to as his great title to fame) in the best light. It could not be altered in manner, and therefore the dragon and his poisonousness must be magnified; but it is not successfully done."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"His view was that the original significance of the pit was to enable Sigurd to escape the blast of flame which passed over his head (cf. 27, lines 1–3)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"30 In Fáfnismál, repeated in the Saga, Sigurd, in answer to Fáfnir’s question, replies that he is called göfugt dýr, that is ‘noble beast’; and a prose note at this point in the Codex Regius explains that ‘Sigurd concealed his name, because it was believed in ancient times that the word of a dying man might have great power if he cursed his foe by his name.’ My father observed that this note was ‘doubtless perfectly correct for the original writer of the poem, whose audience were probably sufficiently of the “ancient times” not to need the explanation!’ He said also that ‘the mysterious words göfugt dýr are probably meant to be obscure, even nonsensical’, though they might be ‘a riddling way of saying “man”.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,33 ‘glamoured’: enchanted.
TEXT_EXTRA,"34 Sigurd’s words in this stanza refer to the œgishjálmr ‘Helm of Terror’ which Heidmar possessed and which Fáfnir took to wear himself: see p.205, and stanza 14. At the words ‘hell now seize him!’ Fáfnir died."
TEXT_EXTRA,"36–41 My father declared the ‘undermeaning’ of Regin’s ‘dark words’ in his preamble to this section of the Lay; and in notes for a lecture (written in pencil at great speed and now not entirely legible) he discussed in detail the relationship in this episode between the Saga and Fáfnismál, seeking to determine not only how the writer of the Saga compressed and modified the verses but why he did so. I give here, with some slight editing, a part of this discussion, since it well illustrates his critical treatment of such problems in the Edda."
TEXT_EXTRA,He begins with a summary of the dialogue of Regin and Sigurd after the death of Fáfnir in the Saga (I give references to the stanzas and lines of the Lay in brackets).
TEXT_EXTRA,"After the death of Fáfnir Regin came to Sigurd and said: ‘You have won a great victory: your glory from it will be eternal’ [35, 1–4]. Then Regin is suddenly or affects to be suddenly stricken with disquiet – ‘he looks upon the ground for a long while’ and says with great emotion ‘it is my brother you have killed and I cannot be accounted innocent of this’ [36, 5–8]. Sigurd dries his sword on the grass, and simply replies ‘you were a long way off at the time when I tested the sword’ (implying therefore ‘innocent enough!’) [37, 1–4]."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Regin counters with the fact that he made the sword [37, 5]; Sigurd counters with ‘brave heart is better than sharp sword in battle’ [38, 3–4]."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Regin does not rebut this, but repeats again ‘with great emotion’ almost his exact words ‘You slew my brother, &c.’ Then Regin cut out the dragon’s heart, drank the dragon’s blood, and asked Sigurd as a sole boon (no sort of reason for which is given) to roast the heart for him."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The repetition by Regin of the words ‘You killed my brother and I can hardly be accounted innocent’ is not a feature of Fáfnismál. Does it serve an artistic purpose – or is it just accidental, due to some confusion in the saga-writer’s source, or in the handing down of the saga? It is probably intentional, and perhaps not bad. The saga-writer has constructed a picture of Regin, already plotting Sigurd’s removal, and trying as it were to justify himself to himself. Scornfully relieved of any share of responsibility by Sigurd, he contents himself with mere repetition – he adheres to his remorse, and to his ‘You slew my brother’ ( i.e. his vengeance)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"After such words Sigurd should have needed no igður [the birds whose voices he could understand, see 41, 8 and 43, 1–3]. That the brother of one you had slain was unsafe was learnt almost at the mother’s knee, certainly on the father’s lap, in Scandinavia – especially when he went out of his way to point it out to you."
TEXT_EXTRA,"There is a curious absence of explanation of the reason why Sigurd must roast the heart. The real reason is of course that Sigurd must cook the heart so as to hear the birds. Fáfnismál supplies a not overwhelming but sufficient reason – ek mun sofa ganga [I shall go to sleep] (we may presume, after the potent draught of dragon’s blood) [39, 5–8, and 40]. Whether there ever was a better reason – connected with this remnant of very ancient belief, the eating of flesh and drinking of blood (of foes especially) to obtain their wisdom and power [40, 5–8; 46, 1–4] we perhaps can no longer say."
TEXT_EXTRA,"It may be noted that Snorri Sturluson says that Regin expressly proposed to Sigurd as terms of reconciliation for the slaying of Fáfnir, that he roast the heart for him."
TEXT_EXTRA,"39 Ridil: Old Norse Riðill, Regin’s sword; Snorri names it Refill."
TEXT_EXTRA,"42–44 In Fáfnismál there are seven stanzas ascribed (in a prose linking-passage) to the words of the birds (of a kind called igður, of uncertain meaning) chattering in the thicket, whose voices Sigurd could at once understand after the blood from the dragon’s heart touched his tongue; but these stanzas are in two different metres. The poem Fáfnismál is not in the verse-form fornyrðislag in which the greater number of the poems of the Edda are written, but in ljóðaháttr. In this metre the stanza falls into two halves of three lines each, of which the third line in each half usually has three stressed elements and double (or treble) alliteration within itself. Only three of the ‘bird-verses’ are in ljóðaháttr, the others being in fornyrðislag; and my father argued forcefully and in detail that the fornyrðislag verses come from another poem (see further the note to 49–54)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The three ljóðaháttr verses, he held, are spoken by two birds, with two main motives selected : gold, fear of treachery, and gold repeated. This is the basis for these three stanzas in the Lay (though the suggestion in 42, 5–6 that Sigurd should eat Fáfnir’s heart himself is introduced from one of the other verses); but – rather oddly – they are cast in ljóðaháttr, thus apparently marking them out as intrusive, since the Lay is in fornyrðislag."
TEXT_EXTRA,To illustrate the form as it appears in Old Norse I give here the first of the three ljóðaháttr verses with a close translation:
TEXT_SPECIAL,Höfði skemra láti hann inn hára þul
TEXT_SPECIAL,Fara til heljar heðan!
TEXT_SPECIAL,"Öllu gulli þá kná hann einn ráða,"
UNKNOWN(dt3),"fjölð, því er und Fáfni lá."
TEXT_EXTRA,"(Shorter by a head, / let him send the grey-haired wizard / hence to hell! All the gold / then can he possess alone, / the wealth, that under Fáfnir lay.)"
TEXT_EXTRA,"46–48 In the Saga Sigurd ate some only of the dragon’s heart, and some he set aside. The purpose of this is seen later in the saga, where it is told that at some time after the wedding of Sigurd and Gudrún ‘Sigurd gave Gudrún some of Fáfnir’s heart to eat, and thereafter she was far more grim than before, and wiser also.’ This element is excluded from the Lay; my father considered it ‘a late piece of machinery to explain Gudrún’s tangled psychology.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"These verses derive from a prose passage in Fáfnismál, closely similar to that in the Saga, which tells that after the death of Regin Sigurd rode on Grani following the tracks of Fáfnir to his lair, which was standing open. The doors and door-posts were of iron, as were all the beams of the house, which was dug down into the earth (46). Sigurd found there a vast store of gold and filled two great chests with it; he took the Helm of Terror and a golden mailcoat and many other precious things, and he loaded them onto Grani; but the horse would not move until Sigurd leaped upon his back."
TEXT_EXTRA,"49 ‘their wit he knew not’: this very unusual use of the word ‘wit’ seems in the context to be equivalent to ‘meaning’, ‘signification’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"49–54 In Fáfnismàl, after Sigurd has slain Regin and eaten the dragon’s heart he hears the igður again; and these five verses are again in fornyrðislag (see the note to 42–44). There is no indication of how many birds spoke, but the first two verses concern Gudrún, and the last three concern a Valkyrie on the mount of Hindarfell, surrounded by fire, sleeping: Ódin stabbed her with the thorn, for she had felled a warrior against his command. See the note on 54 below."
TEXT_EXTRA,"My father held that these verses, like the previous ‘bird-verses’ in fornyrðislag, came from a poem ‘which enlarged on the situation, and probably attempted through the bird-tradition to tell more of the tale’- a trace of a poem that attempted ‘to compress a great deal of the story into one situation.’ While accepting that ‘it is useless to discuss which bird says what’, he thought the guess that one bird speaks the verses concerning Gudrún and a second those about the Valkyrie ‘as good as any’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the Lay he did however retain this second group of ‘bird-verses’ (or more accurately, composed verses that echo their meaning), and gave them to a raven (those about the Valkyrie) and a finch (those about Gudrún), and interlaced them. But he displaced them to follow Sigurd’s entry into Fáfnir’s lair and his loading Grani with the treasure that he found there, so that these birds are speaking of things that may lie ahead for Sigurd as he rides away from Gnitaheiði; whereas in Fáfnismál the prose passage cited in the note to 46–48 follows the second group of ‘bird-verses’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"54 ‘her power wielding, / victory swaying as Valkyrie’. In northern legend and poetry the course and outcome of battles was governed by Valkyries, demonic warrior-women sent out as emissaries of Ódin."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The word Valkyrja means ‘chooser of the slain’: it is given to them to determine who is to die, and to award victory. Perhaps the most striking example of this conception is found in the Hákonarmál, a poem composed in the tenth century on the death of King Hákon the Good of Norway, son of King Harald Fairhair. The poem opens thus:"
TEXT_POEM,Göndul and Skögul Gautatýr sent
TEXT_POEM,to choose who of kings of Yngvi’s race
TEXT_POEM,should go to Ódin and dwell in Valhöll.
TEXT_EXTRA,"Göndul and Skögul are Valkyries; Gautatýr is a name of Ódin. In the poem King Hákon is pictured sitting on the ground with his shield rent and his mailshirt gashed, listening to the words of the Valkyries."
TEXT_POEM,"Then said Göndul, as she leant on the shaft of her spear,"
TEXT_POEM,"‘Now will the might of the Gods grow greater,"
TEXT_POEM,since they have summoned Hákon with a great host
TEXT_POEM,to their dwellings.’
TEXT_POEM,The king heard what the Valkyries were saying
TEXT_POEM,"as they sat on their horses, thoughtful their"
TEXT_POEM,"countenance,"
TEXT_POEM,with helms on their heads and their shields held

TEXT_EXTRA,Then Hákon speaks to the Valkyrie named Skögul:
TEXT_POEM,"‘Why have you decided the battle thus, Geirskögul?"
TEXT_POEM,We have deserved victory of the Gods.’
TEXT_POEM,"‘We have brought it about,’ said Skögul, ‘that you"
TEXT_POEM,"have held the field, and your foes have fled"
TEXT_POEM,away.
TEXT_POEM,"Now we must ride to the green homes of the Gods, to tell to Ódin that a mighty king is coming to him.’"
CHAPTER_NAME,VI BRYNHILDR
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the note to V. 46–48 I have given the content of the prose passage provided in the Codex Regius describing how Sigurd entered Fáfnir’s lair and took from it the great treasure of gold, which he loaded in chests on his horse Grani. This passage is treated in editions of the Edda as the conclusion of the poem Fáfnismál; but in fact it continues without break or new title into the story of Sigurd’s encounter with the Valkyrie asleep on Hindarfell, and this part is treated as the prose introduction to a strange work to which the name Sigrdrífumál is given."

TEXT_EXTRA,"20–23 The Saga, after the words ‘and this they swore to each other with oaths’, continues at once ‘Now Sigurd rides away’. The conclusion of this section of the Lay, referred to in the prose preamble that precedes it (‘They depart together, but the pride of Brynhild causes her to bid Sigurd depart and come back to her only when he has won all men’s honour, and a kingdom’), is a development altogether peculiar to the Lay."
CHAPTER_NAME,VII GUÐRÚN
TEXT_EXTRA,"When in the Lay Sigurd parted from Brynhild his journey took him by intention to the land of the Gjúkings, as is seen from the words (VI.23) ‘green ran the roads / that Grani strode’ together with those of the Finch (V.51) ‘Green run the roads / to Gjúki’s land’. So it is also in Snorri’s greatly condensed account."
TEXT_EXTRA,"8 ‘Niflung land, Niflung lord’, and 12 ‘Niflungs’: on the name Niflungar Snorri Sturluson was specific: Gjúkingar, þeir eru ok kallaðir Niflungar, ‘ the Gjúkings, who are also called Niflungs’. In this commentary, conceived fairly strictly as an elucidation of the treatment of the Norse Völsung legend in my father’s Lay, it is unnecessary to enter even cursorily into the deep matter of origins that lies behind the name Niflungs (German Nibelungen, Nibelungs); but something is said of this in Appendix A, pp.356–63."
TEXT_EXTRA,"14 Mirkwood: Not occurring in the Saga, the Norse name Myrkviðr, Anglicized as ‘Mirkwood’, was used of a dark boundary-forest, separating peoples, and is found in poems of the Edda in different applications; but it seems probable that in its origin it represented a memory in heroic legend of the great forest that divided the land of the Goths from the land of the Huns far off in the south and east. This is what the name means in the Eddaic poem Atlakviða, the Lay of Atli (Attila), whence its appearance here in the Lay."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Danpar: Like Mirkwood, this name is not found in the Saga, but occurs in Atlakviða and elsewhere in Old Norse poetry (see further the note to stanza 86 in the Lay of Gudrún). It is a survival of the Gothic name of the Russian river Dnieper."
TEXT_EXTRA,"15 ‘Borgund lords’: This expression occurs again in stanza 20. My father derived it from the notable words in a verse of the Atlakviða, where Gunnar is called vin Borgunda, lord of the Burgundians. Nowhere else in Norse is Gunnar recognised as a Burgundian, nor is the word found as the name of a people; but very remarkably the same expression is found in one of the fragments of the Old English poem Waldere, where Guðhere is called wine Burgenda. Both the Old Norse Gunnarr and the Old English Guðhere are descended from the name of the historical Burgundian king Gundahari, who was killed by the Huns in the year 437. For an account of the historical origins of the Gjúkings see Appendix A."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Budli’s brother: in the Saga the killing of the brother of King Budli, father of Atli and Brynhild, by the Gjúkings is mentioned at a later point in the narrative."
TEXT_EXTRA,"28 ‘and blind his eye’: Ódin had only one eye: according to the myth that he gave up one of his eyes as a pledge in order to gain a drink from the spring of Mímir, the water of wisdom at the root of the Tree of the World."
TEXT_EXTRA,"38 It is not said in the Lay as it is in the Saga that after drinking Grímhild’s potion Sigurd lost all memory of Brynhild: ‘he drained it laughing, / then sat unsmiling’; but the meaning is clear from IX.4."
TEXT_EXTRA,"39 ‘glamoured’: a word used in V.33 and 47: ‘enchanted’, in the sense of being brought under a spell."
CHAPTER_NAME,VIII SVIKIN BRYNHILDR (Brynhild Betrayed)
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the Saga the wedding of Sigurd to Gudrún follows, and the swearing of brotherhood between Sigurd and the sons of Gjúki (stanzas 7–10 in the Lay); it is said that by this time he had dwelt among the Gjúkings for two and a half years. After they were wedded Sigurd gave Gudrún some of Fáfnir’s heart to eat: see the note to V.46–48. They had a son named Sigmund."

CHAPTER_NAME,IX DEILD (Strife)
TEXT_EXTRA,"As I have said (p.221), the great lacuna in the Codex Regius caused the loss of all ancient Norse poetry for the central part of the legend of Sigurd. The manuscript does not take up again until near the end of a lay of Sigurd which is known as the Brot (af Sigurðarkviðu), the ‘Fragment’ (of a lay of Sigurd). Only some 20 stanzas of this poem are preserved, and these come late in the development of the tragedy, after ‘the quarrel of the queens’, as they washed their hair in the waters of the Rhine. My father noted that it can be seen from what is left of the Brot that there has been lost the greater part of ‘an old and very vigorous poem – for example the supreme vigour and economical force of"
TEXT_POEM,Mér hefir Sigurðr
TEXT_POEM,"selda eiða,"
TEXT_POEM,"eiða selda,"
TEXT_POEM,alla logna . . .’
TEXT_EXTRA,"These words of Gunnar’s come almost at the beginning of the preserved part of the Brot, and are closely echoed in the Lay, IX.46."
TEXT_EXTRA,"3–4 At the end of the feast of the bridal of Gunnar and Brynhild, according to the Saga, Sigurd remembered all his oaths to Brynhild, but he made no sign. There is no suggestion in the Saga of what is implied in stanza 3."
TEXT_EXTRA,"6–11 The quarrel between Brynhild and Gudrún when they washed their hair in the river follows the story as told by Snorri Sturluson and in the Saga, except in the matter of the rings that revealed the truth to Brynhild: see the note to 9–10. A long dialogue between Brynhild and Gudrún which follows in the Saga is eliminated in the Lay."
TEXT_EXTRA,"9–10 As I have noted earlier (p.231), in the Saga Sigurd in Gunnar’s form took the ring Andvaranaut from Brynhild and gave her another from Fáfnir’s hoard, whereas in the Lay, following Snorri Sturluson, this is reversed. So here, in Snorri’s words: ‘Gudrún laughed, and said: “You think that it was Gunnar who rode through the flickering fire? But I think that he who slept with you was the one who gave me this gold ring; but the gold ring which you wear on your hand and which you received as a wedding gift is called Andvaranaut; and I do not think that Gunnar got it on Gnitaheiði.”’ On Gnitaheiði see V.14."
TEXT_EXTRA,"12–20 Brynhild’s withdrawal to her bedchamber in black silence, lying like one dead, and her words with Gunnar when he came to her, derive in a general way from the Saga; but the long reproach that in the Saga she casts at him differs greatly from the equivalent passage in the Lay (stanzas 15–19). In the Saga she began, when at last prevailed upon by Gunnar to speak, by asking him: ‘What have you done with the ring I gave you, which king Budli gave me at our last parting, when you Gjúkings came to him and vowed to harry and burn unless you gained me?’ Then she said that Budli had given her two choices, to wed as he wished, or to lose all her wealth and his favour; and seeing that she could not strive with him she promised to wed the one who would ride through her fire on the horse Grani with Fáfnir’s hoard. This further confusion arising from the ‘doubled’ view of Brynhild is once again eliminated in the Lay, as are other details of the story in the Saga: the fettering of Brynhild by Högni after her threat to kill Gunnar, and her tearing of her tapestry apart."
TEXT_EXTRA,20 Lines 3–4: In the Saga Brynhild ordered the door of her chamber to be set open so that her lamentations could be heard far off.
TEXT_EXTRA,"21–34 The dialogue between Sigurd and Brynhild derives most of its elements from that in the Saga, but in the Lay it is much more compressed and coherent. In the Saga Brynhild does not curse Gudrún, and Sigurd does not say that he would even be willing to kill Gunnar."
TEXT_EXTRA,"26 In the Saga Brynhild said that she wondered at the man who came into her hall, and she thought that she recognised Sigurd’s eyes, but she could not see clearly because ‘her fortune was veiled’."
TEXT_EXTRA,27 Lines 7–8: see VIII.33 lines 3–4 and IX.10 lines 5–8.
TEXT_EXTRA,"29 Lines 1, 3: ‘Woe worth’: A curse upon; ‘Woe worth the while’: A curse upon the time. Again in stanzas 37, 50."
TEXT_EXTRA,"30 Lines 7–8: ‘I sat unsmiling, no sign making’: see IX.3–4."
TEXT_EXTRA,"35 Here in the Saga the writer quoted a verse from a poem that he called Sigurðarkviða, in which it is said that Sigurd’s grief was so great that the links of his mailshirt snapped. Of this verse my father remarked that he did not believe it to come from the same hand as the Brot, and so attributed it to the otherwise wholly lost ‘Sigurðarkviða en meiri’ (see p.234). In the Lay the extravagant idea is characteristically reduced."
TEXT_EXTRA,39–40 Stanzas 39 lines 5–8 and 40 lines 1–4 echo VIII.30.
TEXT_EXTRA,"39–50 Elements in the arrangement of dialogue are altered in the Lay, and the development set in a clearer light and sharper focus. Brynhild’s lie to Gunnar, that Sigurd had possessed her (43), leads to his words to Högni (46): ‘oaths he swore me, all belied them’, which are almost the first words of the Brot (see p.233)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"51–64 There were two distinct versions of the story of the murder of Sigurd, each represented in poems of the Edda. In the Brot he was slain out of doors, and Högni had a part in it (despite his perception that Brynhild had lied to Gunnar, which is seen in a verse of the Brot that is echoed in stanza 47 of the Lay); but in Sigurðarkviða en skamma and other poems he was slain by Gotthorm in his bed (see further pp.243–44). The compiler of the Codex Regius put in a prose note about this at the end of the Brot:"
TEXT_CONTEXT,"In this poem is told of the death of Sigurd, and here the story is that they slew him out of doors; but some say that they slew him within doors, in his bed, sleeping. But German men say that they slew him out in the forest; and so also it is told in Guðrúnarkviða en forna (the Old Lay of Gudrún) that Sigurd and the sons of Gjúki had ridden to the council place when he was slain. But all are agreed in this, that they broke their troth to him, and fell upon him when he was lying down and unprepared."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The Saga follows the story of his death as he slept in the house, and the Lay likewise adopts this version, but introduces (54–57) a brief episode in which Gotthorm encountered Sigurd as he hunted in the forest, and hailed him abusively – perhaps to give colour to what is said in the Saga, and repeated in stanzas 52–3 – that the diet of wolf and snake on which he was fed made him exceedingly bold and fierce."
TEXT_EXTRA,"51 Grímhild’s offspring: the author of the Saga regarded Gotthorm (Gottormr) as a full brother of Gunnar and Högni, and had Gunnar say that they should persuade Gotthorm to do the deed, because he was young and had sworn no oath. My father here followed a tradition, found in the poem Hyndluljóð, that Gotthorm was the half-brother of Gunnar and Högni, being ‘Grímhild’s offspring’; Snorri Sturluson, also, says that Gotthorm was Gjúki’s stepson."
TEXT_EXTRA,"58–59 In the Saga, Gotthorm went twice to Sigurd’s chamber in the morning, but Sigurd looked at him, and Gotthorm dared not attack him on account of his piercing gaze; when he came the third time Sigurd was asleep."
TEXT_EXTRA,"67–69 These stanzas echo the concluding verses of the Brot, which does not extend to the death of Brynhild."
TEXT_EXTRA,"73 In the Saga, following Sigurðarkviða en skamma, Brynhild dying foretold all the later history of Gudrún; this has no place in the Lay."
TEXT_EXTRA,"77 Lines 5–7 are an exact repetition of lines 3–5 in III.13, where the ‘son’s son’ is Sinfjötli, except that the reading there is Völsung, not Völsungs. The plural form here is clear, but may nonetheless be erroneous. On the form Valhöllu see the note to III.13."
TEXT_EXTRA,"77–82 The concluding passage is of course peculiar to the Lay. With stanzas 79–81 cf. Upphaf, the opening section of the Lay, stanzas 11, 14–15."
TEXT_EXTRA,"77–78 In a fragmentary poem of the tenth century on the death of the ferocious Eirik Blood-axe, son of King Harold Fairhair and brother of Hákon the Good (see the note on V.54) there is a remarkable image of the coming of an ‘Ódin hero’ to Valhöll. The poem opens with Ódin declaring that he has had a dream in which he was preparing Valhöll to receive a company of the slain. There is a great noise of many men approaching the hall, and Ódin calls on the dead heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise up quickly and go to meet the dead king who is coming, saying that he believes it to be Eirik."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Sigmund says to Ódin: ‘Why do you hope for Eirik, rather than for other kings?’ And the god replies: ‘Because he has reddened his sword in many lands.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"Then Sigmund asks: ‘Why have you robbed him of victory, when you knew him to be brave?’ And Ódin answers: ‘Because it cannot be clearly known. . .’ – and then (at any rate as the text stands) he breaks off, and concludes: ‘The grey wolf is gazing at the dwellings of the Gods’ (see the commentary on the Upphaf (‘Beginning’), pp.185–86."
UNKNOWN(fm-1-1),Note on Brynhild
TEXT_EXTRA,"In what follows I set out, with minor editing, the content of some notes of my father’s, written very rapidly in soft pencil and difficult to read, on his interpretation of the tangled and contradictory narratives that constitute the tragedy of Sigurd and Brynhild, Gunnar and Gudrún. I will repeat here what I have said in my Foreword, that there is nothing in these or any other notes for his lectures on Old Norse literature that bears on the question of whether he had written, or intended to write, poems on the subject of the Völsung legend; but that views expressed in the lectures may illuminate, naturally enough, his treatment of the sources in his Lays."

TEXT_EXTRA,(4) Her comfort fails and her pride is mortally wounded when she discovers that it was Sigurd after all who rode the flame: in addition she has been tricked into breaking her oath to wed the actual rider.
TEXT_EXTRA,"(5) Her vengeance takes this form: she cannot have Sigurd now, and therefore she will destroy him (and so mortally wound Gudrún, the natural object of her hate); but she will by this very act avenge herself on Gunnar by involving him in a dreadful oath-breaking – so that after all is over, Sigurd dead, and she about to follow, she can turn and say, ‘Sigurd is pure of all such vileness, you Gunnar alone are shamed’ [this is the end of the Brot, echoed in stanzas IX.67–69 in the Lay]."

TEXT_EXTRA,"The earlier manuscript material of the Upphaf is not easy to interpret. There are two versions, which are readily placed in sequence: these I will call for ease of reference text A and text B. The first, or text A, with the title Upphaf, has almost as many stanzas as the final form, but not all in the same order, and the wording constantly differing, if for the most part only slightly. The opening stanza is among those that underwent the most change to reach the final form:"
TEXT_POEM,Ere the years there yawned
TEXT_POEM,"yearless ages,"
TEXT_POEM,without sand or sea
TEXT_POEM,"silent, empty;"
TEXT_POEM,Earth was not moulded
TEXT_POEM,nor arched Heaven:

TEXT_POEM,for Frey the fair
TEXT_POEM,flames of Surtur;
TEXT_POEM,the doom of Thór
TEXT_POEM,the Dragon beareth:
TEXT_POEM,all shall be ended
TEXT_POEM,and Earth perish.
TEXT_EXTRA,"Though not so marked in the manuscript, the words of the Sibyl clearly end here, and stanzas 14–15, in which the Sibyl speaks of the rôle of Sigurd at the Ragnarök, are here absent. Then follow in A stanzas 16–20 of the final text, the conclusion of the Upphaf, in which the Gods prepare for the Last Battle according to the prophecy, and ending with the words ‘for one they waited, / the World’s chosen’. In A at this point the meaning of those words is not explained. But in this version it is the stanzas 14–15 of the final form, absent here from the prophecy of the Sibyl, that form the conclusion of the Upphaf. The first reads:"
TEXT_POEM,In Day of Doom
TEXT_POEM,he should deathless stand
TEXT_POEM,to die no more
TEXT_POEM,"who had death tasted,"
TEXT_POEM,the serpent-slayer.
TEXT_POEM,"seed of Óðinn,"
TEXT_POEM,"the walls defending,"
TEXT_POEM,the World’s chosen.
TEXT_EXTRA,"And the concluding stanza in text A is virtually the same as stanza 15 in the final form. Thus the prophecy concerning Sigurd is present in A, but not as the words of the Sibyl."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"And that is, I think, all I have to say (of my own) concerning the Elder Edda. There is the ancient measure and strophe in which most of it is written – in which our own poetry was once composed, and in which it still can be if one will learn the craft (not an easy one) – there is the background of the imagination of its poets; and though this is not a translation of an Eddaic poem it is just like one, and all its elements may be found in that book, most of them in the very first poem of all which deals directly with this very theme."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Only the opening paragraphs of the paper are preserved, either because they were written on the same page as the last stanza of the poem and the rest was discarded, or because the paper never went beyond this point, at any rate in this form."

TEXT_POEM,Gunnar spake then gloomy-hearted:
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),8
TEXT_POEM,"Then spake Högni, haughty chieftain:"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),9
TEXT_POEM,Then spake Grímhild grey with wisdom:
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),10
TEXT_POEM,"Gudrún they sought, grieving found her in woodland house weaving lonely; weaving wondrous webs bright-figured with woe tangled and with works of old."
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),11
TEXT_POEM,"Ódin she wrought old, blue-mantled; Loki lightfooted with locks of flame; the falls of Andvari framed of silver, the gold of Andvari she gleaming wove."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),12
TEXT_POEM,"The house of Völsung huge was timbered, the Tree there tossed tangled branches. There Grímnir’s gift gleaming brandished Sigmund standing stern unbending."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),13
TEXT_POEM,"The hall of Siggeir high was burning fire-encircled flame-devouréd. Signý stood there Sigmund greeting, fire about her, flame behind her."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),14
TEXT_POEM,"Shields of silver had the ship of Sigmund; wild the waves were, wind them twisted. Sailed there slowly Sinfjötli’s bier through stormy seas steered by Ódin."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),15
TEXT_POEM,There Regin wrought by the red embers; there Gram was hammered amid gleaming sparks. High loomed the head of helméd dragon; under black belly there was blink of gold.
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),16
TEXT_POEM,"Long lay the shadow of lone rider golden-harnessed Gram brandishing; sun-bright Sigurd seed of Völsung, on Grani riding into Gjúki’s courts."
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),17
TEXT_POEM,"Golden weregild Gunnar brought her, haughty Högni humbly bent him. Gudrún they hailed, Gunnar and Högni; head she turned not, hate still burned her."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),18
TEXT_POEM,In came Grímhild guileful-hearted:
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),19
TEXT_POEM,"Gudrún lifted her grieving eyes, dimmed with weeping, dark with mourning. Dark with wisdom, deep with purpose were Grímhild’s eyes gazing through her."
TEXT_POEM,Grímhild
UNKNOWN(tp),20
TEXT_POEM,"‘Atli ariseth, armies wieldeth, king of Eastland’s countless peoples. His queen shall rule courts of splendour, over all women else on earth upraised.’"
TEXT_POEM,Gudrún
UNKNOWN(tp),21
TEXT_POEM,"‘Of gold were the days, gold and silver, silver and golden, ere Sigurd came. A maid among maids in mirth walked I; only dreams and shadows, only dreams vexed me."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),22
TEXT_POEM,"A hart I dreamed high and golden: now is sped the shaft and spilled the blood. A wolf thou gavest me for woe’s comfort, in my brethren’s blood he bathed me red."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),23
TEXT_POEM,"I love them little, I believe them not, but my brethren’s blood is no boot for me. How shall husband heal me of harm I bear in hateful Hunland who am hopeless now?’"
TEXT_POEM,Grímhild
UNKNOWN(tp),24
TEXT_POEM,"‘Thy brothers blame not! Brynhild wrought it, thy wrong and sorrow – it rues them sore. And dreams are but dreams, or else doom foretell; yet doom must be dreed, though dreams foreshow."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),25
TEXT_POEM,"Hungold is bright, Hunland is wide, Atli mightiest of earthly kings. And gold is healing, though grieve the heart; a queen’s bed better than one cold and bare!’"
TEXT_POEM,Gudrún
UNKNOWN(tp),26
TEXT_POEM,"‘Why drivest me on with daunting eyes dire of purpose, doom forestalling? To Sigurd thou gavest me, to sorrow it turned; now leave me to rest, leave thy daughter!’"

UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),28
TEXT_POEM,"Dark hung her eyes daunting Gudrún, deep and dreadful, dire with purpose. For no word she waited, wisdom knew she; forth went Grímhild from Gudrún’s side."
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),29
TEXT_POEM,"Of Gudrún’s beauty glad was Atli; of gold he dreamed him guarded darkly; of the serpent’s hoard that Sigurd left her, of the wife of Sigurd of women fairest."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),30
TEXT_POEM,"Bridal drank he blissful-hearted to Gudrún pale in gleaming robes. Oaths he swore them, to each her brothers, and lasting truce, league of kinship."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),31
TEXT_POEM,"Dark and splendid, dreadly builded, and echoing vast were Atli’s halls. Kings sat neath him, countless chieftains, and Hunnish horsemen harnessed grimly."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),32
TEXT_POEM,"High sat Gudrún Hunland’s mistress, cold lay Gudrún queen of Hunland. Her lord loved her, lovely was she; laughter she knew not, yet her limbs were white."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),33
TEXT_POEM,"But longer him lasted his lust of gold, the gold he dreamed him guarded darkly. The serpent’s treasure they sent it never, the Niflungs kept it in Niflung-land."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),34
TEXT_POEM,"Long he pondered, till lust swayed him; woes were wakened and wars of old. Long nights lying he looked on her; dark nights drowsing he dreamed of gold."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),35
TEXT_POEM,"Oaths he had uttered, evil he pondered; but his heart’s purpose was hidden under. Yet words he muttered in wandering sleep; Gudrún guessed them, gloom foreboding."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),36
TEXT_POEM,"A feast he fashioned, far proclaimed it; to high-builded halls his hosts were bidden; all kith and kindred called to greet him, to dealing of rings, drink and laughter."
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),37
TEXT_POEM,"On valiant horse Vingi swiftly, herald of Hunland, hasted westward. To Gunnar came he, Gjúking mighty, to halls of Rhineland high and golden."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),38
TEXT_POEM,"There drank they deep; dark they eyed him, Hun-speech hearing in their hall ringing. Cold fell his cry calling loudly under helm standing hailing Gunnar."
TEXT_POEM,Vingi
UNKNOWN(tp),39
TEXT_POEM,"‘Atli hath sent me on errand speedy, on horse hasting through hoar forest. Gunnar he greeteth, Gunnar and Högni. Be blithe he bids you, to his boon hearken!"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),40
TEXT_POEM,"A feast he fashions, fair he dights it, all kith and kindred calls to meet him. Rings will he deal, raiment costly, saddles silverlaid, and southern purple."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),41
TEXT_POEM,"Shields shall ye choose there and shirts of mail, spears smooth-shafted and splendid helms. Gifts will he give you, graven silver, gold-hilted swords, and goodly lands.’"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),42
TEXT_POEM,His head bowed Gunnar to Högni speaking:
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),43
TEXT_POEM,"Is there sword in the East that my sword matcheth? Are there helms in Hunland so high as ours? Are we lieges of Atli, lands receiving from Hun master? Högni answer!’"
TEXT_POEM,Högni
UNKNOWN(tp),44
TEXT_POEM,"‘Of Gudrún I think – grim thoughts awake! A ring she hath sent me, a ring only. Wolf’s hair winds it, woven round it, wolves lie in wait at the way’s ending.’"
TEXT_POEM,Gunnar
UNKNOWN(tp),45
TEXT_POEM,"‘Yet runes she sends me, runes of healing, words well-graven on wood to read; fast bids us fare to feast gladly, old woes forgetting and ancient wrong.’"
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),46
TEXT_POEM,"Gifts gave Gunnar, guerdon kingly; wine bade men bring to weary guest. Deep there drank they to day’s ending, doom they recked not; din resounded."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),47
TEXT_POEM,"In came Grímhild grey with wisdom, the runes she read, the written tokens. Her brows darkened boding evil; to Gunnar spake she grave and slowly."
TEXT_POEM,Grímhild
UNKNOWN(tp),48
TEXT_POEM,"‘These runes I doubt: they are writ with cunning, strangely twisted, stained and darkened. There were others under, now overlaid – if I read them right they were runes of ill.’"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),49
TEXT_POEM,"Gunnar had drunken, to his guest turned he:"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),50
TEXT_POEM,Laughing said Vingi:
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),51
TEXT_POEM,"I must haste away, so will hide it not, that Atli is old, but Erp is young. Thy sister’s son is but seven winters – strong hands he needs to steer his realm."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),52
TEXT_POEM,"In Gunnar hoped he for guide and help, of his sister’s son the safe keeper. He weened ye might wield his wide kingdom – ye are fallen afraid, and fear shadows.’"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),53
TEXT_POEM,Högni him answered hard and scornful:
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),54
TEXT_POEM,"Yet Atli I heard not too old for guile, war to ponder, or wealth to covet. And fey saith my thought: “Far lies the day ere Erp or Eitill after Atli rule!”’"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),55
TEXT_POEM,"But loud cried Gunnar laughing scornful, deep had he drunken darkly musing:"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),56
TEXT_POEM,"Winds shall wander where wine we drank, but Gunnar will go Gudrún seeking. We fast shall follow thy feet, Vingi! Our horns shall be heard Hunland rousing.’"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),57
TEXT_POEM,(From heavy heart then Högni answered:)
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),58
TEXT_POEM,"Then vowed Vingi the venom-tonguéd – oaths he recked not, the oft forsworn:"
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),59
TEXT_POEM,"Niflungs rode forth from Niflung-land; fast their journey, few went with them. Grímhild stood there grey and aged, dark eyes were dimmed death foreseeing."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),60
TEXT_POEM,"Their word was spoken, wills were hardened; fate drove them on, fey they parted. None might hinder near them thronging, lords nor wisemen; with a laugh they rode."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),61
TEXT_POEM,"Steeds went striding, stonefire glinted, rocks were ringing, roads resounding. In hoar forests harts were startled, over hill and valley hooves were beating."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),62
TEXT_POEM,"Over river rowed they roaring onward; oars were bending urged to breaking. Foam flew from prow, flashed and sparkled; at bank unbound the boats left they."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),63
TEXT_POEM,In the hoar forest horns they sounded Hunland rousing; hooves were beating. Golden harness gleamed and sparkled; steeds came striding stung to madness.
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),64
TEXT_POEM,"From hill upon high halls they looked on, walls and watchtowers wondrous-builded. They were forest-girdled, fenced with spearmen; horses neighed there, helms were glinting."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),65
TEXT_POEM,"There was clamour in the courts, cold rang the steel; shafts were shaken, shields them answered. Gates found they barred, grim doors of iron: Högni smote them, hewed them fiercely."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),66
TEXT_POEM,(Forth came Vingi the venom-tonguéd:)
TEXT_POEM,Högni
UNKNOWN(tp),67
TEXT_POEM,"‘Heralds were holy – but unhallowed liar, thou shalt hang the first, and hell take thee!’ From the oak-branches with arms corded they hung him high in the Huns’ faces."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),68
TEXT_POEM,"Huns loud clamoured, hate was kindled; forth rushed they fell, fierce the onslaught. In battle blended Budlungs, Niflungs; blades were brandished, burst were helmets."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),69
TEXT_POEM,"Back they beat them broken-harnessed; to the doors they drove them – din was in the gates. In leaped Högni, held the gateway, hewed two-handed, hurled them backward."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),70
TEXT_POEM,"The few and fearless as a fire entered, as roaring flame, wrath devouring. Wolves sprang behind, the ways were reddened, the walls echoed, wailing filled them."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),71
TEXT_POEM,"Steep, stone-builded, the stair arose to dark doorways dreadly timbered. There Högni halted, hailed them loudly:"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),72
TEXT_POEM,"Out came Atli, anger-clouded:"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),73
TEXT_POEM,"That gold give me that is Gudrún’s right, that Sigurd conquered, the serpent’s treasure!’ Högni laughed then, on his hilts leaning; Gunnar glowering grimly answered."
TEXT_POEM,Gunnar
UNKNOWN(tp),74
TEXT_POEM,"‘No gold from Gunnar shalt thou get for ever! Life canst thou take at latest end. Dear wilt thou buy it in dread barter of lords and lieges, lives uncounted!’"
TEXT_POEM,Atli
UNKNOWN(tp),75
TEXT_POEM,"‘Fools the Niflungs, feud-forgetful; foul-stained their hands with friend-murder. Gudrún’s husband for Gudrún’s wrong a grim vengeance will gladly wreak.’"
TEXT_POEM,Gunnar
UNKNOWN(tp),76
TEXT_POEM,‘Here Gudrún spake not! Golden weregild she looks nor longs for – the lust is thine!’
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),77
TEXT_POEM,Horns they sounded – hall-walls echoed – strode the stairway; stern their onslaught. The stones they stained with streaming blood; snaketonguéd arrows sang about them.
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),78
TEXT_POEM,"Doors clanged backward, din resounded: Hunland’s champions hurled upon them. Hard were handstrokes, hewn were corslets, as on hundred anvils were hammers ringing."
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),79
TEXT_POEM,"In hall sat Gudrún at heart weary, from mood to mood her mind wavered. The din she hearkened, deadly crying, as back were beaten the Borgund-lords."
TEXT_POEM,Gudrún
UNKNOWN(tp),80
TEXT_POEM,"‘Little I love them, long I hated! A wolf they gave me for woe’s comfort. Yet the wolf rends them, and woe is me! Woe worth the hour that of womb I came!’"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),81
TEXT_POEM,"Her hands she wrung on high standing, loud called she clear to lieges there:"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),82
TEXT_POEM,"Who would love requite, who would lies disown, who remember misery by these masters wrought, arm now! arm now! aid the fearless betrayed and trapped by this troll-people!’"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),83
TEXT_POEM,"Atli sat there, anger burned him; yet murmurs mounted, men were rising. Goths were there many: griefs they remembered, wars in Mirkwood and wars of old."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),84
TEXT_POEM,"From the hall striding high they shouted, foes turned to friends fiercely greeted: ‘Goths and Niflungs our gods helping will hew the Huns to hell’s shadow!’"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),85
TEXT_POEM,The few and fearless fiercely answered (their backs were driven to the builded walls):
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),86
TEXT_POEM,"Of the Goths’ glory Gunnar sang there; of Iormunrek earth-shadowing king; of Angantýr and old battles, of Dylgja, Dúnheið, and Danpar’s walls."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),87
TEXT_POEM,"Forth went Högni, hate rekindled, his son Snævar at his side leaping. Hewn was Högni by a Hun chieftain; his shield was shorn in shards falling."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),88
TEXT_POEM,"Snævar they slew there, their swords stabbed him; he left his life laughing grimly. Högni wept not; from his hand the shield stooping lifted; strode then onward."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),89
TEXT_POEM,"The stairs they strode streaming redly; at dark doorways they dinned and hammered; into halls of Atli hewed a pathway; rushed in roaring, reeking-handed."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),90
TEXT_POEM,"Gudrún they greeted, Gunnar and Högni:"
TEXT_POEM,Gudrún
UNKNOWN(tp),91
TEXT_POEM,"‘If for wrongs ye wrought ruth now moves you, doom forestall not! This deed forego!’"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),92
TEXT_POEM,"Forth went Atli, anguish gnawed him; to Gudrún Högni said grim farewell:"
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),93
TEXT_POEM,"Forth sent Atli his errand-riders; Hunland hearkened, hosts were arming. Gallowsfowl to gladden Goths and Niflungs from the hall they hurled the Hunnish corpses."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),94
TEXT_POEM,"Daylight grew dim, dark shadows walked in echoing halls that Atli loved. In need most dire the Niflung lords doom awaited; the doors were shut."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),95
TEXT_POEM,Night lapped the world and noiseless town; under ashen moonlight the owls hooted. At guarded doorways Gunnar and Högni silent sat they sleepless waiting.
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),96
TEXT_POEM,First spake Högni:
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),97
TEXT_POEM,Gunnar answered:
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),98
TEXT_POEM,"There is tramp of men torches bearing, clink of corslet, clank of armour. There is crying of ravens, cold howls the wolf, shields are shimmering, shafts uplifted.’"
TEXT_POEM,Gunnar & Högni
UNKNOWN(tp),99
TEXT_POEM,"‘Wake now, wake now! War is kindled. Now helm to head, to hand the sword. Wake now, warriors, wielding glory! To wide Valhöll ways lie open.’"
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),100
TEXT_POEM,At the dark doorways they dinned and hammered; there was clang of swords and crash of axes. The smiths of battle smote the anvils; sparked and splintered spears and helmets.
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),101
TEXT_POEM,"In they hacked them, out they hurled them, bears assailing, boars defending. Stones and stairways streamed and darkened; day came dimly – the doors were held."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),102
TEXT_POEM,"Five days they fought few and dauntless; the doors were riven, dashed asunder. They barred them with bodies, bulwarks piling of Huns and Niflungs hewn and cloven."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),103
TEXT_POEM,(Atli spoke then anguish mourning:)
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),104
TEXT_POEM,Woe and wailing in my wide kingdom! Where I feasted long are fell serpents. The proud pillars are purple-stained in the builded halls that Budli reared.’
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),105
TEXT_POEM,"Then Beiti spake there bale devising, the king’s counsellor – he was cunning-hearted:"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),106
TEXT_POEM,"Fire still may tame these fell serpents, thy pillars be the pyre of these proud robbers!’ For the ruin and wrack wrath seized Atli; that shame he shirked not, shorn of glory."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),107
TEXT_POEM,"Flame-encircled fearless Niflungs in riven harness redly glinted. Iron-bolted walls, ancient timbers, creaked and smouldered, cracked and tumbled."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),108
TEXT_POEM,"There hot and smoking fell hissing embers, and plashed and sputtered in the pools of gore. Reek was round them, a rolling smoke; dank dripped their sweat – the doors were held."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),109
TEXT_POEM,Their shields they raised over shattered helmets; they stamped the brands on streaming floors. Blacktongued with thirst blood there drank they; fell one by one on the ways to hell.
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),110
TEXT_POEM,"Out burst the brethren blackhued, grisly, boars bleeding-tusked at bay at last. The Huns grasped them helmless, shieldless, bare and bleeding, with broken swords."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),111
TEXT_POEM,"As hounds affrighted Huns were crying; they were rent and riven by reeking hands. Necks were broken and knees sundered, ere the Borgund king was bound and thrown."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),112
TEXT_POEM,"Last fought Högni alone hopeless; his teeth tore them as they tied him down. The dust was bitten, the doom fallen, the Need of the Niflungs and their night was come."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),113
TEXT_POEM,In dank prison dark and evil Högni hurled they; Huns him guarded. But Gunnar bound in Gudrún’s bower was flung at the feet of her frenzied lord.
TEXT_POEM,Atli
UNKNOWN(tp),114
TEXT_POEM,"‘Too long have I looked for this last meeting, Budlung’s vengeance on Borgund lord. Here lies at last in lowly dust lordly Gunnar! Gudrún behold!"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),115
TEXT_POEM,"Sigurd remember, and say me now, is it sweet to see him so sore avenged? In my serpent-pit snakes are waiting – they bite more bitter than blades of steel!’"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),116
TEXT_POEM,"Gunnar he trampled, Gudrún saw him:"
TEXT_POEM,Atli
UNKNOWN(tp),117
TEXT_POEM,"‘Let them give me the gold, the gleaming hoard, the serpent’s treasure that Sigurd conquered! The gold, the gold that grieves my dreams – if Gunnar will grant it, I will grant him thee!’"
TEXT_POEM,Gunnar
UNKNOWN(tp),118
TEXT_POEM,"‘I will give thee the gold, goodly portion, the half yielding which I hold my own. Half hath Högni, my haughty brother; to his latest breath he will loose it not."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),119

UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),121
TEXT_POEM,"Out went Atli, evil he purposed; but wisemen bade him wary counsel. The queen fearing of cunning thought they; a thrall they seized and thrust in prison."

UNKNOWN(tp),122
TEXT_POEM,"‘Woe worth the wiles and wars of kings, if my life I must lose in their luckless feud! The light of morning, labour daylong, fire at evening, too few my days!’"
TEXT_POEM,Huns
UNKNOWN(tp),123
TEXT_POEM,"‘Hjalli, swineherd, thy heart give us!’ Shrilly shrieked he at the shining knife. They bared his breast, and bitter wailed he; ere the point pricked him he piercing cried."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),124
TEXT_POEM,"Högni heard him, to the Huns spake he:"
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),125
TEXT_POEM,The heart then cut they from Hjalli’s bosom; to Gunnar bore it on golden dish:
TEXT_POEM,Gunnar
UNKNOWN(tp),126
TEXT_POEM,‘I hapless see here heart of craven. Högni hath not heart that trembles. Quivering lies it; quaked it swifter beating in baseborn breast ignoble.’
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),127
TEXT_POEM,"Loudly laughed he at life’s ending, when knife was come to Niflung lord. The heart they cut from Högni’s bosom; to Gunnar bore it on golden dish."
TEXT_POEM,Gunnar
UNKNOWN(tp),128
TEXT_POEM,"‘I haughty see here heart undaunted. Högni held it, heart untrembling. Unshaken lies it, so shook it seldom beating in boldest breast of princes."

UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),132
TEXT_POEM,Fires of madness flamed and started from eyes of Atli; anguish gnawed him:
TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),133
TEXT_POEM,"There gleaming-eyed Gudrún waited; the heart within her hardened darkly. Grim mood took her, Grímhild’s daughter, ruthless hatred, wrath consuming."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),134
TEXT_POEM,"There grimly waited Gunnar naked; snakes were creeping silent round him. Teeth were poisoned, tongues were darting; in lidless eyes light was shining."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),135
TEXT_POEM,"A harp she sent him; his hands seized it, strong he smote it; strings were ringing. Wondering heard men words of triumph, song up-soaring from the serpents’ pit."
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),136
TEXT_POEM,"There coldly creeping coiling serpents as stones were staring stilled, enchanted. There slowly swayed they, slumber whelmed them, as Gunnar sang of Gunnar’s pride."

TEXT_POEM,"An ancient adder evil-swollen, to breast it bent and bitter stung him. Loud cried Gunnar life forsaking; harp fell silent, and heart was still."

TEXT_POEM,*
UNKNOWN(tp),
UNKNOWN(tp),141
TEXT_POEM,Pyres they builded proud and stately; Hunland’s champions there high upraised. A pyre they builded on the plain standing; there naked lay the Niflung lords.

TEXT_POEM,"Flames were mounting, fire was roaring, reek was swirling ringed with tumult. Smoke was fading, sunk was burning; windblown ashes were wafted cold."

UNKNOWN(tp),143
TEXT_POEM,"A hall was thronging, Huns were drinking the funeral feast of fallen men. Foes were vanquished, fire had burned them; now Atli was lord of East and West."

PART,COMMENTARY on GUÐRÚNARKVIÐA EN NÝJA
CHAPTER_NAME,COMMENTARY on GUÐRÚNARKVIÐA EN NÝJA
TEXT_CONTEXT,"In this commentary Guðrúnarkviða en Nýja is referred to as ‘the Lay of Gudrún’, or where no confusion is possible as ‘the Lay’, and Völsungakviða en Nýja as ‘the Lay of the Völsungs’. As there are no sections in this poem, references are made simply by the numbers of the stanzas."
TEXT_STORY,"The relation of the Lay of Gudrún to its ancient sources is not essentially different from that of the Lay of the Völsungs, but in this case the sources are very largely extant in the poems of the Edda, and the Völsunga Saga is of far less importance. In its content the Lay of Gudrún is essentially a complex interweaving of the Eddaic poems Atlakviða and Atlamál, together with some wholly independent developments."
TEXT_EXTRA,"3–4, 6 These stanzas echo in their language the verses that Gunnar sang when he first came to the halls of Gjúki, and use several of the same phrases: see the Lay of the Völsungs, VII.14–15 and notes. Gunnar was recalling the earlier wars of Goths and Huns (14), and the battles in which ‘the Borgund lords met Budli’s host’, and slew Budli’s brother (15)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The compiler of the Codex Regius wrote a prose passage entitled Dráp Niflunga ‘The Slaying of the Niflungs’, evidently intended as an introduction to the poem that follows in the manuscript, which is Guðrúnarkviða en forna, the Old Lay of Gudrún. The passage begins thus:"
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Gunnar and Högni seized all the gold, the patrimony of Fáfnir. At that time there was strife between the sons of Gjúki and Atli: he charged them with the death of Brynhild. This was how they were reconciled: they were to give him Gudrún in marriage – and they gave her a draught of oblivion to drink, before she would consent to be married to Atli."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Here, as in the Old Lay of Gudrún itself, Brynhild is the daughter of Budli, and the sister of Atli. Since in my father’s version of the story Brynhild was not associated with Atli this element is absent from his Lay of Gudrún. ‘There is no trace in Atlakviða of Brynhild and all that complication,’ he wrote, ‘and in so far as the motive is apparent – it is not explicit – it is the greed of Atli and the cursed hoard that are at the bottom of the trouble.’ On the drink of oblivion see the note to 17–28."
TEXT_EXTRA,"10–16 Atlakviða and Atlamál do not take up the story until the coming of Atli’s messenger to the Gjúkings. The primary source for the story of Gudrún after the death of Sigurd is Guðrúnarkviða en forna (which has the story that Sigurd was not murdered in his bed but out of doors, see the note to IX.51–64 in the Lay of the Völsungs). In this poem Gudrún looks back in lamentation, and tells how she went and sat at night by the body of Sigurd where it lay in the forest; from there she wandered on and came at last to Denmark. It was in Denmark with Thora Hákon’s daughter that the tapestry was woven, and it was there that Gunnar and Högni came to her, together with Grímhild."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the Lay (stanza 2) Gudrún is said to have gone ‘witless wandering in woods alone’, and when Grímhild and her sons found her she was still living alone, and weaving her tapestry in a ‘woodland house’ (10)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the brief text (iii) concerning this poem given on pp.52–53 my father wrote: ‘Gudrún did not take her own life, but for grief was for a time half-witless. She would not look upon her kinsmen nor upon her mother, and dwelt apart in a house in the woods. There after a while she began to weave in a tapestry the history of the Dragon-hoard and of Sigurd.’ Thus the introduction of the tapestry in the Eddaic poem became a device, having a wholly different content, to link Guðrúnarkviða en nýja to Völsungakviða en nýja."
TEXT_EXTRA,"17–28 An important element in Guðrúnarkviða en forna which is absent from the Lay of Gudrún is the draught of forgetfulness given to Gudrún by Grímhild, intent on making her forget her injuries and consent to be wedded to Atli. In the poem, followed by the Saga, several stanzas are devoted to Grímhild’s potion, and its curious ingredients enumerated at length. But very strangely, the draught has no effect on Gudrún’s mind: in the verses that follow she fiercely withstands Grímhild’s persuasions; and it has been commonly supposed therefore that stanzas have been disordered, those referring to the potion being placed too early."
TEXT_EXTRA,"My father did not accept this explanation. The first draft of oblivion, administered by Grímhild to Sigurd, he believed to have been invented ‘to account for the difficulties raised by the previous betrothal of Sigurd and Brynhild’ (see p.244). ‘Here,’ he wrote, ‘we have the same mechanism again resorted to – and I think deplorably: for the mere repetition is distasteful, these drinks of Grímhild are too powerful or too powerless: why not give one to Atli too, and make him forget the Hoard!’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"He thought it very probable that the stanzas relating to Grímhild’s drink of forgetfulness was an interpolation by a later hand. In his Lay of Gudrún it is gone, and Gudrún (as is seen from stanza 28) submitted without sorcery to the strength of purpose of her formidable mother. In the Saga her last words to Grímhild were ‘Then so it must be, but it is against my will; and no joy will come of it, but rather grief.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"22 Gudrún’s dream is repeated from the Lay of the Völsungs, VII.2–4; lines 5–8 of the present stanza, referring to Atli, are repeated from VII.4, with change of ‘A wolf they gave me’ to ‘A wolf thou gavest me’."
TEXT_EXTRA,23 ‘boot’: remedy.
TEXT_EXTRA,"24 ‘dreed’: endured (as in the Lay of the Völsungs, VIII.4)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"29 ‘of gold he dreamed him’: this is a relic, apparently, of an old impersonal construction of the verb ‘dream’: ‘he dreamed of gold’. These lines reappear in stanza 33."
TEXT_EXTRA,"32–34 In Atlamál the life of Atli and Gudrún has been a horror of hatred and dissension; stanzas 32 and 34 of the Lay suggest rather the story glimpsed in Atlakviða, where when Gudrún stabs Atli in his bed it is said:"
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘Often had the ways of love been better, when those twain were wont many a time to embrace before their noble court.’ In the Lay of Gudrún Atli is explicitly presented as torn between his love of Gudrún and his desire for the Niflung hoard."
TEXT_EXTRA,35 In Atlamál (followed by the Saga) Gudrún overheard what Atli and his men said together in secret; in the Lay this is changed to her overhearing what Atli muttered in his sleep.
TEXT_EXTRA,"36 ‘kith’: friends, neighbours, acquaintance (the original sense of the word in the phrase ‘kith and kin’); again in stanza 40."
TEXT_EXTRA,"37–48 The narrative elements of the Hunnish messenger and the ring and runes sent by Gudrún are derived from both Atlakviða and Atlamál. The name Vingi is from Atlamál, but ‘Cold fell his cry’ (38) comes from Atlakviða, where Atli’s messenger, there called Knefröðr, kallaði kaldri röddu ‘cried with a cold voice’, which as my father noted bore here a distinct sense, ‘ill-boding, fateful’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"From Atlakviða come also the great gifts offered by Atli, and the words of Gunnar and Högni concerning Atli’s invitation. In Atlakviða Gudrún’s warning takes this form, in Högni’s words:"
TEXT_POEM,Hár fann ek heiðingja
TEXT_POEM,riðit í hring rauðum.
TEXT_POEM,Ylfskr er vegr okkar
TEXT_POEM,at ríða örindi.
TEXT_EXTRA,"(I found a hair of the heath-roamer / wound in the red ring./ Treacherous as a wolf is the road for you and me / if we ride on this errand.) But in Atlamál the wolf’s hair is eliminated, and Gudrún sent a message in runes, which Vingi altered before he delivered it."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the Lay of Gudrún both motives are combined (stanzas 44–5), and in this my father was following the Saga and the note entitled Dráp Niflunga in the Codex Regius. This latter adds that the ring was Andvaranaut (taken by Sigurd from Brynhild and given to Gudrún: but not so in the Lay of the Völsungs, see the note to IX.9–10)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"39 ‘boon’: request, entreaty."
TEXT_EXTRA,"40 ‘dights’: prepares, makes ready."
TEXT_EXTRA,"42–58 I set out here the interweaving of sources in this passage in some detail, since it exhibits very clearly my father’s narrative method in this poem."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In Atlakviða, Gunnar asks his brother why they should be tempted by Atli’s bounty when they themselves own such wealth and such arms (see the Lay stanzas 42–3), and Högni, not replying directly, speaks of the wolf’s hair twisted round Gudrún’s ring. With no further direct indication of Gunnar’s thoughts, he at once makes the decision to go, crying Úlfr mun ráða arfi Niflunga, the wolf shall possess the heritage of the Niflungs, if he does not return. In Atlamál, on the other hand, neither Gunnar nor Högni are shown to hesitate at all. The runic message that replaced the wolf’s hair of Atlakviða causes them no disquiet. It is only subsequently that Högni’s wife Kostbera examines the runes and perceives that they have been overlaid on those originally cut; but Högni dismisses her warning, as he also dismisses her warning dreams. Gunnar’s wife Glaumvör likewise has oppressive dreams, but they too are dismissed by Gunnar; and the brothers set out next morning. Kostbera and Glaumvör appear only in Atlamál and are not taken up into the Lay of Gudrún."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the Saga a further element is introduced, in that Vingi, seeing that the brothers have become drunk, tells them that Atli, now aged, wishes them to become the rulers of his kingdom while his sons are so young (see stanzas 51–2 in the Lay). It is this that makes Gunnar decide to go, and Högni reluctantly to agree, before the closer examination of the runes and the telling of the dreams take place."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the Lay my father has taken elements from both the Eddaic lays and from the Saga, but rearranged the context, so that the implications are somewhat altered. Gunnar’s scorn for Atli’s offer and Högni’s warning about the wolf’s hair are preserved, but Gunnar is now persuaded to accept the invitation by the ostensible meaning of Gudrún’s runic message (45). It is Grímhild, not Kostbera, who warns that the runes have been tampered with, and that the underlying meaning was quite other – and this leads Gunnar to tell Vingi that he will not now come (49). This is the occasion of Vingi’s final seduction (51–2); and though Högni remains scornfully unconvinced (53–4), Gunnar, who had ‘deep drunken’, cries out echoing the words of Atlakviða: ‘Let wolves then wield wealth of Niflungs!’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"The scene ends with a return to the runes: Högni observing heavily that when Grímhild’s counsel ought to be attended to they dismiss her warning, and Vingi swearing, in an echo of his words in Atlamál, that the runes do not lie. Gunnar’s character is maintained: see p.52(ii)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"50 ‘rune-conner’: one who pores over, closely examines, runes."
TEXT_EXTRA,"54 ‘fey saith my thought’: I take, but doubtfully, the word ‘fey’ here to mean ‘with presage of death’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"59 ‘few went with them’: in Atlakviða there is no mention of any companions of Gunnar and Högni; in Atlamál they had three, Högni’s sons Snævar (named in stanzas 87–8 of the Lay) and Sólar, and his wife’s brother Orkning."
TEXT_EXTRA,"59–63 On their journey to the land of the Huns, as my father wrote of the passage in Atlakviða (see p.313), ‘the Niflungs ride fen and forest and plain to Atli’. Stanza 62 is derived from Atlamál, where the furious rowing of Gunnar and Högni and their companions is described; but in the Lay the localized Scandinavian scene of Atlamál is not intended – they are crossing the Danube."
TEXT_EXTRA,60 ‘fey’: fated to die.
TEXT_EXTRA,"62 lines 7–8: this also is derived from Atlamál. My father remarked in a lecture that the abandoning of the boat by the Niflungs, since they hoped for no return, seems to be a detail that belongs to the oldest form of the legend as it reached the North, since it is found also in the German Nibelungenlied."
TEXT_EXTRA,"65–67 While the great courts of Atli are obviously quite differently conceived from the farmstead of Atlamál, Högni’s beating on the doors derives from it, as does the slaying of Vingi – though in Atlamál they struck him to death with axes."
TEXT_EXTRA,"68–92 In Atlakviða there is no fighting when Gunnar and Högni come to Atli’s halls. Gudrún meets her brothers as they enter and tells them that they are betrayed. Gunnar is at once seized and bound (and it is here that he is called vin Borgunda ‘lord of the Burgundians’, the only surviving trace in Old Norse literature of the Burgundian origin of the Gjúkings: see p.228, note on VII.15). Högni slew eight men before he was taken."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In Atlamál, on the other hand, as in the German Nibelungenlied, there is fierce fighting on the arrival of Gunnar and Högni, and Gudrún, in this poem leaving the hall and coming to her brothers outside, takes part in it and herself strikes down two men. The fighting lasted through the morning, and eighteen of Atli’s men were slain before Gunnar and Högni were taken. Then Atli speaks and laments his marriage and the loss of his men."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the Lay this part of the narrative is greatly extended beyond what is told in either of the Eddaic lays or in the Völsunga Saga. The Saga introduces the idea of a lull in the fighting, not found in Atlamál, when Atli spoke of his loss and his evil lot, before the battle was rejoined and the brothers forced their way into the hall (cf. stanzas 71 ff. in the Lay). But after fierce fighting Gunnar and Högni were taken prisoner; whereas in the Lay the result of the assault is that they hold Atli at their mercy – and Gudrún persuades them to show it."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The Lay is far removed from Atlamál in the portrait of Gudrún, who is naturally not here presented as a fierce warrior-woman; and an entirely new element is introduced in the presence of Gothic warriors at Atli’s court (83), on whom Gudrún calls for aid and who rise against their Hunnish masters (81–6); see the note to 86."
TEXT_EXTRA,68 Budlungs: men of Budli (Atli’s father).
TEXT_EXTRA,80 ‘A wolf they gave me’: see the note to stanza 22.
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘Woe worth the hour’: see the note to the Lay of the Völsungs, IX.29."
TEXT_EXTRA,86 The introduction in the Lay of the Burgundians’ newfound allies in the Goths at Atli’s court leads to these references to ancient Gothic names remembered in old lays. This stanza is an innovation of my father’s.
TEXT_EXTRA,"Iormunrek (Jörmunrekkr) was the Norse form of the name of Ermanaric, king of the Ostrogoths, the eastern branch of the Gothic people, who dwelt in the South Russian plains in the fourth century. The vast dominion of Ermanaric extended over many tribes and peoples from the Black Sea north towards the Baltic; but about the year 375, in his old age, he took his own life, in the face of the first overwhelming onset of the Asiatic steppe nomads, the Huns, who inspired widespread terror by their savagery and their appearance. To that distant time the song of Gunnar reached back, as did his minstrelsy at the feast held in honour of Sigurd in the halls of Gjúki (the Lay of the Völsungs, VII.14); the line ‘earth-shadowing king’ in the present stanza no doubt refers to the vastness of Ermanaric’s empire."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the centuries that followed Ermanaric became a mighty figure in the heroic legends of Germanic-speaking peoples, his name darkened by the evil deeds that attached to his fame. In the few traces of Old English heroic legend that survive he was remembered as wrað wærloga, ‘fell and faithless’, and in the little poem called Deor he appears in these lines:"
TEXT_POEM,We geascodon Eormanrices
TEXT_POEM,wylfenne geþoht: ahte wide folc
TEXT_POEM,Gotena rices: þæt wæs grim cyning.
TEXT_EXTRA,‘We have heard of the wolfish mind of Eormanric: far and wide he ruled the people of the realm of the Goths: he was a cruel king.’
TEXT_EXTRA,"The names in lines 5–8 are derived from The Battle of the Goths and the Huns, a very ancient and ruinous Norse poem embedded in Heiðreks Saga (also called Hervarar Saga), which is to be seen as the bearer of remote memories of the first Hunnish attacks on the Goths, with ancient names preserved in a traditional poetry."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Of these names, Angantýr is a Gothic king; and Dúnheiðr, scene of a great battle, probably contains Norse Dúna, the Danube. ‘Danpar-banks’ in Gunnar’s earlier song (Lay of the Völsungs VII.14) and ‘Danpar’s walls’ in the present stanza derive from the Norse Danparstaðir, a survival of the Gothic name of the river Dnieper. Of its occurrence in Atlakviða my father noted in his lecture that it was ‘a reminiscence probably of Gothic power and splendour in the old days before Ermanaric’s downfall’."
TEXT_EXTRA,87 Snævar is named in Atlamál as one of Högni’s sons (note to 59).
TEXT_EXTRA,"91 ‘ruth’: sorrow, regret."
TEXT_EXTRA,"93–112 This part of the narrative in the Lay is entirely independent of the Norse sources. Atli, being released, now sent for reinforcements (93), while the Niflungs held the doors of the hall (95) – and in this the German tradition of the legend appears, but strongly influenced by the Old English poetic fragment known as The Fight at Finnsburg (which is not in itself in any way connected with the Niflung legend). Beside stanzas 96–99 may be set the opening of The Fight at Finnsburg (translation by Alan Bliss, cited from J.R.R. Tolkien, Finn and Hengest, ed. Bliss, 1982, p.147):"
TEXT_CONTEXT,‘... gables are burning.’
TEXT_CONTEXT,"Hnæf spoke, the warlike young king: ‘Neither is this the dawn from the east, nor is a dragon flying here, nor are the gables aflame; nay, mortal enemies approach in ready armour. Birds are crying, wolf is yelping; spear clashes, shield answers shaft. Now that this moon shines, wandering behind the clouds, woeful deeds are beginning, that will bring to a bitter end this well-known enmity in the people. Awaken now, my warriors! Grasp your coats of mail, think of deeds of valour, bear yourselves proudly, be resolute!’"
TEXT_EXTRA,In the Lay the fighting is said to have lasted for five days (102); and in The Fight at Finnsburg the same is said.
TEXT_EXTRA,"It is interesting to see that in lecture notes on the Nibelungenlied my father wrote ‘compare Finnsburg’ against his reference to the scene when Hagen (Högni) and his mighty companion Volker the Minstrel guarded at night the doors of the sleeping-hall where the Burgundians were quartered, and saw in the darkness the gleam of helmets. So also he wrote of the Old English poem in Finn and Hengest (edition referred to above, p.27): ‘The Fragment opens with the “young king” espying an onset – like the helmets gleaming when the sleeping hall is attacked in the Nibelungenlied.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"The German tradition is again present in the burning down of the hall in which the Niflungs were besieged. But in the Nibelungenlied, and in the thirteenth century Norwegian Thiðrekssaga based on North German tales and songs, this is altogether differently motivated, for it was Kriemhild (Gudrún in the Norse legend) who inspired the invitation to Hunland, in order to get vengeance on Gunther and Hagen (Gunnar and Högni) for the murder of Siegfried (Sigurd). It was Kriemhild who gave the order for the hall in which the Nibelungs slept to be set on fire; whereas in the Lay of Gudrún it is one Beiti, counsellor of Atli, who was the instigator of the burning (105). But the detail of the trapped warriors drinking blood from the corpses (109) is derived from the Nibelungenlied."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In Atlakviða Gudrún set the hall on fire at the end of the poem, after the murder of Atli and their children, and this appears at the end of the Lay of Gudrún (153)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"105 The name Beiti is derived from Atlamál, where he is Atli’s steward (see note to 118–131)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"112 ‘the Need of the Niflungs’. ‘Need’ is written with a capital because the phrase echoes the last words of the Nibelungenlied: ‘Here the story ends: this was der Nibelunge nôt.’ The word nôt, which is in origin the same as English need, refers to the terrible extremity and end of the Nibelungs."
TEXT_EXTRA,"113–116 Atli’s treatment of the bound Gunnar before Gudrún’s eyes, while taunting her with the vengeance now achieved for Sigurd, is found neither in the Eddaic poems nor in the Völsunga Saga; but it is the spring of Gudrún’s ‘ruthless hatred’ (133) and of her insanely savage action after her brothers have been killed: she makes her demand for her brothers’ lives (116) in the form ‘by Erp and Eitill our own children’ (and in 120 ‘by those born of us!’)."
TEXT_EXTRA,114 ‘Budlung’s vengeance’: the vengeance of Atli son of Budli.
TEXT_EXTRA,"118–131 In Atlakviða Gunnar, asked if would purchase his life with the gold, replied that ‘The heart of Högni must lie in my hand.’ They cut the heart from one ‘Hjalli the craven’ instead, and laid it before Gunnar, who knew that it was not Högni’s heart, because it quivered; but it is not in any way explained why they did this. Then they cut out Högni’s heart, and Gunnar knew that it was his, since it quivered scarcely at all. In Atlamál it is Atli who commanded the cutting out of Högni’s heart, but Beiti Atli’s steward suggested that they take Hjalli the cook and swineherd instead, and spare Högni; they seized the screaming Hjalli, but Högni interceded for him, saying that he could not endure the noise, and that he would ‘rather play out this game myself’. Then Hjalli was released, and Högni was killed, and there is no mention of the story of the two hearts."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the Saga the two are rather crudely combined: Atli commands that Högni’s heart be cut out, a counsellor of Atli proposes the substitution of Hjalli, Högni intercedes for him; Atli then tells Gunnar that he can only purchase his life by revealing where the treasure lies, Gunnar replies that he must first see Högni’s heart, and so Hjalli is seized again and his heart cut out, and the rest of the story is as in Atlakviða."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the Lay of Gudrún the sources are interwoven more skilfully: it is Gunnar who demands to see Högni’s heart, as in Atlakviða, but an explanation is provided (121) for the preliminary assault on Hjalli the swineherd: ‘wisemen bade him / wary counsel’ (they told Atli to beware), fearing the queen’s wrath. Högni does not inter-cede for Hjalli, but merely expresses his distaste for the shrieking; and the swineherd is given no respite."
TEXT_EXTRA,"120 ‘Of his troll’s temper / yet true were the words!’ Atli refers, I believe, to Gunnar’s words (118) concerning Högni and the gold: ‘to his latest breath / he will loose it not.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,122 ‘Woe worth the wiles’: A curse on the wiles; cf. ‘Woe worth the while’ in the Lay of the Völsungs IX.29 and note.
TEXT_EXTRA,124 ‘liever’: more acceptable.
TEXT_EXTRA,"128–130 In Atlakviða, when they brought the heart of Högni to Gunnar, he declared that ‘Always I had a doubt, while two of us lived; but now I have none, since I alone am living. The Rhine shall possess the gold that stirs men to strife, the Niflungs’ inheritance. In the rolling water shall the fatal rings gleam, rather than that gold should shine on the hands of the sons of the Huns.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"The actual casting of the gold into the Rhine is not referred to in Atlakviða (as it is in the Lay, 130, line 5, ‘in the deeps we cast it’), and this led to the contention that Gunnar meant no more than that he would rather see the hoard drowned in the Rhine than adorning the Huns. My father strongly rejected this, on several grounds: the syntax of the passage; the statement by Snorri Sturluson in the Prose Edda that ‘before they [Gunnar and Högni] departed from their land they concealed the gold, the heritage of Fáfnir, in the Rhine river, and that gold has never since been found’; and the references in the Nibelungenlied to the sinking of the treasure in the Rhine. He thought it probable that it was already part of the legend when it came North."
TEXT_EXTRA,"He noted also that the answer to the question, if the treasure was in the Rhine, what would it matter whether Högni were alive or dead, must be that Högni was the only party to the secret of where in the great river it lay; so in the Völsunga Saga Gunnar says: ‘And now I alone know where the gold is, and Högni will not tell you’, and Snorri’s ‘that gold has never since been found’. ‘Doubtless it could have been fished up,’ my father wrote, ‘if you knew just where to look.’ He believed nonetheless that the episode was a later elaboration (he called it ‘theatrical-dramatic’), not perfectly fitting with the Rhine-gold motive: see further the note to 148–150."
TEXT_EXTRA,"130 lines 5–8: compare the lines from near the end of Beowulf, 3166–8:"
TEXT_POEM,"forleton eorla gestreon eorðan healdan,"

TEXT_EXTRA,(From an alliterative translation by my father of Beowulf lines 3137–82.)
TEXT_EXTRA,"132–140 In Atlamál it is said, and it is repeated by Snorri, that Gunnar in the snake-pit played the harp with his feet, an idea that may have arisen from the observation that he was bound, as is told in Atlakviða (and in the Lay, 113). In the Lay, following Atlakviða, Gunnar used his hands. Other features of this episode in the Lay are derived from the Saga: that Gudrún sent him the harp (135), that his playing put the serpents to sleep (136), and that he was finally stung to death by a huge adder (139)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"141–147 The great funeral pyres are not in the Eddaic poems, but Gudrún’s revenge on Atli is told in both – the same hideous motive as appears in the Greek legend, told by Ovid in the Metamorphoses, of Procne, who for vengeance killed her own son Itys and gave his flesh to her husband, Tereus King of Thrace, to eat."
TEXT_EXTRA,"142 Lines 5–8 are repeated almost exactly from the first stanza of the poem, where they are used of the pyre of Sigurd and Brynhild."
TEXT_EXTRA,"148–50 I have said (p.312) that my father ‘tentatively interpreted the state of Atlakviða as the reworking of an earlier poem, a reworking that had then itself undergone “improvements”, additions, losses, and disarrangements’. He believed that both the ‘Högni-Hjalli episode’ (see note to 118–131) and Gudrún’s revenge on Atli through their own children were later elaborations by ‘the Atlakviða poet’ on the earlier poem that he was reworking."
TEXT_EXTRA,"This last section of Atlakviða, constantly difficult to interpret in the detail of its language, is not altogether intelligible at large, logically or psychologically. As it stands, Gudrún came to meet Atli when he returned from the murder of Gunnar in the snake-pit and welcomed him to the feast with a golden cup (cf. the Lay, stanza 145), brought drink and food to the assembled company, waited on Atli – and then declared with ghastly clarity what she had done and what they were doing. A great cry of horror and noise of weeping arose from the benches, but Gudrún did not weep: ‘she scattered gold, with red rings enriched the men of her household.... Atli unsuspecting had drunk himself bemused; weapons he had not, he was not ware of Gudrún’ (this last phrase is my father’s translation of a Norse verb of uncertain meaning here). Then follows Gudrún’s murder of Atli in his bed before she set the hall on fire."
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘Why the distribution of gold,’ my father wrote, ‘when no help or favour was needed by Gudrún, or could be expected by a declared murderess of princes? Why the foolishness of Atli not suspecting Gudrún?’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"His tentative solution was to suppose that while the perishing of Atli’s son, or sons, may have been a very old part of the legend, it was not originally an essential part of Gudrún’s revenge. The form in which we here find it interwoven (he wrote) is certainly mainly a Norse development, and the end of a long process. It is probable that it was not present in the ‘original source’ of Atlakviða, and that its introduction and interweaving with the main theme of revenge was the work of the Atlakviða poet."
TEXT_EXTRA,"He supposed that in an earlier form the story would have moved, after the funeral feast, to the verse describing Gudrún’s gold-giving, which would in this case be naturally interpreted as her continuing the pretence of cheerfulness, and acceptance, distributing rich gifts to allay suspicion. Then Atli, ‘unsuspecting’ – because he had no reason for suspicion – went to his bed very drunk (this being one of the oldest elements in the whole story, see Appendix A, pp.345–46). But when the motive of the murdered children entered it had necessarily to be introduced in the course of the funeral feast. The stanzas referred to above were retained, but they were not successfully fitted to the insertion (‘Why the distribution of gold? Why the foolishness of Atli?’)."
TEXT_EXTRA,In his Lay of Gudrún my father devised a remedy for this in Atli’s swoon of horror that caused the servants to carry him to his bed (148–149).
TEXT_EXTRA,"The author of Atlamál here suddenly turns to a tradition that Högni had a son who avenged him on Atli, and says (followed by the Saga, and by Snorri) that this son, who has not been previously mentioned in the poem, aided Gudrún in the murder. As is to be expected, this has no place in the Lay of Gudrún."
TEXT_EXTRA,152–154 The burning of the hall by Gudrún is derived from Atlakviða: see note to 93–112.
TEXT_EXTRA,"156 Lines 5–8 are almost the same as the last lines of the Lay of the Völsungs (IX.82), and become also the last lines of the Lay of Gudrún (stanza 165) before the parting words of the poet to his audience."
TEXT_EXTRA,"157–165 In a pencilled note on the manuscript my father wrote that all the conclusion of the poem from stanza 157 should be omitted, only the final stanza 166 being retained. Rough lines drawn on the manuscript, however, show the omission as extending only to stanza 164, so that the last four lines of 156 are the same as the last four lines of 165 immediately following."
TEXT_EXTRA,"159–165 The verses given to Gudrún as she sits beside the sea are inspired by the late Eddaic poem Guðrúnarhvöt, but there is little close correspondence. The latter part of that brief lay is one of several ‘Laments of Gudrún’; but it includes her grief over the final element in the Northern legend, which for his purposes in these poems my father excluded."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In Guðrúnarhvöt Gudrún tells that she attempted to drown herself in the sea, but the waves cast her up (as in the Lay of Gudrún 158), and her story was not ended. Early on, a wholly distinct and very ancient Gothic legend was threaded on to the acquisitive Niflung theme. This legend concerned the death of the Ostrogothic king Ermanaric (see note to 86) at the hands of two brothers, in revenge for the murder of their sister; and the sister, Swanhild (Svanhildr), became the wife of Ermanaric and the daughter of Sigurd and Gudrún, her brothers (Hamðir and Sörli) the sons of Gudrún by her third and last marriage to a shadowy king named Iónakr."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Earlier in the Lay of Gudrún, when Gunnar sang of ancient Gothic deeds (86), he named Iormunrek (Ermanaric); and this of itself shows that my father was cutting away the Gothic legend from his Niflung poem, and setting Iormunrek in a historical context – for in history Ermanaric died some sixty years before Gundahari (Gunnar) king of the Burgundians."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Only in Guðrúnarhvöt is there any reference in Norse literature to the manner of Gudrún’s death (self-destruction on a funeral pyre); but in the Lay of Gudrún she utters her lament, and again giving herself to the waves is this time taken."
PART,APPENDICES
CHAPTER_NUMBER,APPENDIX A
CHAPTER_NAME,A short account of the ORIGINS OF THE LEGEND
CHAPTER_NAME,§ I Attila and Gundahari
TEXT_EXTRA,"In both Lays my father used the expression ‘Borgund lord(s)’, chiefly in reference to Gunnar, or Gunnar and Högni (who are also called ‘Gjúkings’ and ‘Niflungs’). In the commentary on the Lay of the Völsungs, VII.15, I have explained that he derived the name ‘Borgund’ from a single occurrence in Atlakviða of the title vin Borgunda ‘lord of the Burgundians’, applied to Gunnar, and that nowhere else in Norse literature was Gunnar remembered as a Burgundian. In this title appears one of the chief elements in the legend."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The Burgundians were in origin an East Germanic people who came out of Scandinavia; they left their name in Bornholm (Norse Borgunda holm), the island that rises from the Baltic south-east of the southern tip of Sweden. In the Old English poem Widsith they are named together with the eastern Goths (Ostrogoths) and the Huns: ‘Attila ruled the Huns, Ermanaric the Goths, Gifica the Burgundians’, which may be taken to be a memory of a time when the Burgundians still dwelt in ‘East Germania’; but they moved westwards toward the Rhineland, and it was there that disaster overtook them."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Early in the fifth century they were settled in Gaul, in a kingdom on the west bank of the Rhine centred on Worms (south of Frankfurt). In the year 435, led by their king Gundahari, the Burgundians, impelled as it seems by the need for land, embarked on an expansion westwards; but they were crushed by the Roman general Aetius and forced to sue for peace. Two years later, in 437, they were overwhelmed by a massive onslaught of the Huns, in which Gundahari and a very large number of his people perished. It has been commonly supposed that the Roman Aetius, whose primary purpose was to defend Gaul from the encroachments of the barbarians, called in the Huns to destroy the Burgundian kingdom of Worms. There is no reason to suppose that Attila was the leader of the Huns in this battle."
TEXT_EXTRA,"But the Burgundians of the Rhineland were not wholly destroyed in 437, for it is recorded that in 443 the survivors were allowed to settle as colonists in the region of Savoy. A curious glimpse of them is found among the writings of Sidonius Apollinaris, a cultivated Gallo-Roman aristocrat, Imperial politician, and poet, born in Lyons about 430, and in his later years the bishop of Clermont, the chief city of the Auvergne. He left in his letters a portrait of the manners and mode of life in the strange society of southern Gaul in the fifth century."
TEXT_EXTRA,"But to the fastidious Sidonius the gross Burgundians were repellent and their culture wholly without interest. In a satirical poem he complained humorously of having to sit among the long-haired barbarians (who were excessively fond of him) and be forced to endure Germanic speech: to praise with a wry face the songs sung by the gluttonous, seven foot tall Burgundians, who greased their hair with rancid butter and reeked of onions. Thus we learn nothing from him of the songs which were sung by the contemporaries of Gundahari and Attila, but only that his own muse fled away from the noise."
TEXT_EXTRA,"That they preserved their traditions, however great the disaster of 437, is suggested by a Burgundian code of laws drawn up King Gundobad not later than the early sixth century, in which the names of ancestral kings are cited: Gibica, Gundomar, Gislahari, Gundahari. These names all appear in later legend, though it cannot be known what were the historical relationships between them. Gundahari is Gunnarr (vin Borgunda) in Norse. He appears in Old English in the very dissimilar but ultimately identical form Guðhere: in the poem Widsith the minstrel says that when he was ‘among the Burgundians’"
TEXT_POEM,me þær Guðhere forgeaf glædlicne maððum
TEXT_POEM,songes to leane; næs þæt sæne cyning.
TEXT_EXTRA,(‘there Guðhere gave me a glorious jewel in reward for my song: he was no sluggish king.’) In the German tradition he is Gunther.
TEXT_EXTRA,"Gibica, in the form Gifica, appears in the Old English Widsith as the ruler of the Burgundians together with the rulers of the Goths and the Huns, as I have mentioned above. In Norse the name became by regular phonetic change Gjúki, who is the father of Gunnar; in forms of the German tradition Gibeche is likewise the father of Gunther; but (especially in view of the placing of Gifica in Widsith) it may be that he was in history an illustrious ancestor of an older time."
TEXT_STORY,"‘It is easy to understand,’ wrote R.W. Chambers in his edition of Widsith (1912) ‘why the story of the fall of Gundahari and his men in battle against the Huns was of interest not merely to the Burgundian, but to all his neigh-bours, till, as the centuries passed, it became known from end to end of Germania. Eight centuries after his fight Gundahari was still remembered from Iceland to Austria.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"With this view my father did not altogether concur. In notes for lectures primarily on the knowledge of the Völsung legend among Old English poets, he said: ‘Guðhere’s tale is one of downfall after glory – and sudden downfall, not slow decay – sudden and overwhelming disaster in a great battle. It is the downfall, too, of a people that had already had an adventurous career, and disturbed things in the west by their intrusion and by the rise of a considerable power at Worms. It is easy to see how their defeat by Aetius only two years previously would be telescoped in the dramatic manner of legend into the defeat by the Huns (if not actually connected in history, as it may have been)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘Guðhere, already valiant and a generous goldgiver as patron in Widsith, must have been very renowned. Mere downfall, without previous glory, did not excite minstrels to admiration and pity. However, we are probably not far wrong in guessing that there must – quite early – have been some other element than mere misfortune in this tale to give it the fire and vitality it clearly had: living as it did down the centuries. What this was we can hardly guess. Gold? It may well have been that gold, or the acquisition of some treasure (that later still became connected with some renowned legendary gold) was introduced to explain Attila’s attack. Attila (when legend or history is not on his side) is represented as grasping and greedy. It may have been in this way that Guðhere ultimately got connected with the most renowned hoard, the dragon’s hoard of Sigemund [in Old English], of Sigurd [in Old Norse].’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"My father did not mean to imply that, in history, Attila was the leader in the attack on the Burgundians in 437, for which there is no evidence. He saw that ‘Attila only appears in the story by an early legendary, or dramatic, simplification and heightening of the importance of the battle in which Guðhere perished. He became essential to it.’ In the eighth century the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon (monk of Monte Cassino) knew Attila as the foe; and from his account it is seen that by then the tradition was that Gundahari was not slain in his own town of Worms, but marched eastwards to meet Attila: and this was an invariable feature of the legend in all its forms."
TEXT_STORY,"Profound as was the impression made in Germanic legend by the colossal figure of Attila, there is no occasion in this book to outline the history of the most renowned of all the barbarian kings, which necessarily involves the political and military complexities, often obscure, of his relations with the disrupted Empire; and indeed, in the development of the legend in Norse, it could be said that it was the manner of his death that counted for more than his life. At the same time there is no need, I think, to pass over altogether the extraordinarily clear glimpse of that fearful tyrant and destroyer that survives from more than fifteen centuries ago (in such contrast to Gundahari, of whose personal characteristics we know nothing at all)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"This is owing to an accomplished and well-informed historian named Priscus of Panium (that being a town of Thrace), whose large work in Greek Of Byzantium and the events connected with Attila survives, lamentably, only in fragments; but one of those fragments contains the story of his journey into Hungary as a member of a small diplomatic deputation to Attila sent out from Constantinople, capital of the Eastern Empire, in the summer of the year 449. Attila received the Roman embassy in the village of wooden buildings that was his headquarters, standing in the midst of a vast plain without stone or tree; and Priscus not only narrowly observed the banquet at which Attila presided, and much else, but described it in such sharp detail as to suggest that he took notes at the time of all that he saw. In this unique account of a barbarian banquet in the Heroic Age Priscus described the elaborate and interminable ceremony in which Attila drank to the health of each guest in turn, and the fine feast served on looted silver dishes with looted drinking-cups of silver and gold – in contrast to the unadorned simplicity of Attila, who drank from a wooden cup and ate only meat, on a wooden plate. He described the entertainment provided: there were singers who chanted songs in praise of the great deeds of Attila; there was a madman, and a buffooning dwarf, who aroused loud laughter, but not from Attila, who sat through all this in grim and rigid silence. But when his youngest son Ernac entered the hall Priscus saw that Attila looked at him ‘with softened gaze’ and stroked his face. He asked a Hun who sat beside him for an explanation of this, and he replied that the soothsayers had told Attila that the fortunes of his family would fail, but would be restored to greatness by this son. The carouse lasted far on into the night, but the Romans prudently withdrew long before it ended."
TEXT_EXTRA,"A description of the physical appearance of Attila is found in the work of a sixth-century historian of the Goths named Jordanes, and this description is directly derived from Priscus, though the original is lost. He was short in stature with a broad chest; his small beady eyes were set in a huge face; his nose was flat and his skin swarthy, his beard straggly and flecked with grey. His step was haughty, and he had a way of darting his glance hither and thither, ‘so that the power of his great spirit appeared in the movement of his body’."
TEXT_STORY,"Most important for the large evolution of the legend was the great event of the year 451, the most famous battle of that age. In that year Attila moved with a huge army westwards towards the Rhine, mounting an attack on Gaul for which his motives are obscure. The Huns had destroyed the Ostrogothic power in the east in the fourth century, and Attila ruled over a great mixed dominion, as the Goths had done under Ermanaric (see the commentary on the Lay of Gudrún, stanza 86, pp.322–3). In his empire, and so also in his armies, were many East Germanic peoples; and now in his host came the Ostrogoths under their king Valamer, the Gepids under Ardaric, Rugians, Thuringians, and warriors of other nations beside. Against them came in uneasy alliance the Visigoths (the western Goths) of Tolosa (Toulouse) under their aged king Theodoric, Aetius the Roman general, Burgundians from their new lands in Savoy, Franks, even a contingent of Saxons. The battle is known as the Catalaunian plains (the plain of Champagne) and the Mauriac plain; it was fought in the region of Troyes (a hundred miles south-east of Paris)."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Of the course of the battle very little is known. Jordanes, writing a century later, said that it was bellum atrox, multiplex, immane, pertinax (ferocious, confused, monstrous, unrelenting). Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, was among the vast numbers of the slain. The fighting continued into the night, and Attila retreated into his camp, which he had fortified with waggons. According to Jordanes, he had a great funeral pyre heaped up out of horses’ saddles on which he intended to be burnt before final defeat should overtake him."
TEXT_EXTRA,"But the final assault was never made. The alliance against him broke up. Again according to Jordanes, the imminent prospect of the total destruction of the Huns filled Aetius with alarm. His deepest fear was the power of the Visigothic kingdom in the south of France, centred on Toulouse; and despite the eagerness of the young king of the Visigoths, Thurismund, to avenge on the Huns the death of his father in the battle, Aetius advised him to return to Toulouse, lest his brothers should seize the throne in his absence. This counsel Thurismund accepted (‘without perceiving its duplicity’); the Visigoths departed from the battlefield, and Attila was allowed to escape from Gaul."
TEXT_STORY,"In the year 452, following the great battle, Attila crossed the Alps, and came down into Italy from the north-east. The cities of the north Italian plain were not only ravaged by the Huns but in some cases actually razed to the ground. Aquileia at the head of the Adriatic, which both as fortress and great trading centre was one of the foremost cities of northern Italy, was so utterly destroyed that when Jordanes wrote, a century later, there was scarcely a trace of it to be seen. Patavium suffered the same fate, and though unlike Aquileia it rose again, it is a striking fact that Padua has no Roman remains."
TEXT_EXTRA,"But Attila never crossed the Apennines, making for Rome. Whatever the reason, he returned to Hungary; and in the following year, 453, he died. The story of his death is known from Jordanes; but Jordanes expressly stated that he was following the authority of Priscus, and it can be taken to be precise history."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Attila in this year added one more to his many wives (innumerabiles uxores in Jordanes’ words: the Huns were highly polygamous). His wife was a very beautiful girl named Ildico (it has been commonly thought probable that her name shows her to have been of Germanic origin – a diminutive form of Hild, or any name ending in -hild; perhaps a Burgundian). At the wedding feast Attila became hugely drunk and took to his bed, ‘heavy with wine and sleep’; and there as he lay on his back he suffered a violent nose-bleeding, and was choked to death by the blood passing down his throat. Late on the following day his servants broke down the doors and found him lying dead and covered with blood ‘without a wound’, his bride weeping, covered by her veil."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Jordanes described the funeral of Attila, clearly still following the lost narrative of Priscus. His body was laid in a silken tent out on the plain, and the finest horsemen of the Huns rode round in circles, ‘after the manner of the circus-games’; and they told of his deeds in a funeral song. After wild extremes of grief and joy his body was buried at night, covered in gold, and silver, and iron, with weapons taken from his enemies and many treasures; and then, ‘in order that human curiosity should be kept away from such riches’, those who performed the work of burial were killed. In the same way, after the death of Alaric king of the Visigoths in 410, the captives were made to divert the mountain-river Busento in Calabria from its bed, and then after the burial of the king and the returning of the river to its ordinary course they were all put to death."
TEXT_EXTRA,"But the figure of Attila rose from his tomb and took different shapes in the centuries that followed. Among Latin-speaking peoples he was taken up into what has been called ‘ecclesiastical mythology’, and became Flagellum Dei, the Scourge of God, divinely appointed to the devastation of a wicked world. In the lands of Germania there were two radically distinct traditions concerning him: he appears in a double light, generous patron and monstrous foe, and it is not difficult to see how this should have come about. On the Catalaunian plains there was a colossal conflict between men of many Germanic nations. As I have said, in the hosts of Attila went men of many East Germanic peoples subject to the Huns, most notably the Ostrogoths, and for them Attila was the great King and overlord, to whom their own kings paid allegiance: indeed his very name Attila looks like a diminutive form of the Gothic word atta, ‘father’. In South German (High German) tradition Attila, his name changed in the course of time through phonetic movement to Etzel, is a benevolent monarch, hospitable and ineffectual, far removed from the Attila of history."
TEXT_EXTRA,"But in more northerly lands his legendary image was derived from his enemies, and thence, by whatever route it came, the Scandinavians derived their grim and covetous king Atli, murderer of the Burgundians for the sake of the Nibelung hoard."
TEXT_STORY,"The story that Jordanes, following Priscus, told of the manner of Attila’s death is beyond question the historical fact; and the knowledge that that was how he died was known to Chaucer more than nine hundred years later. His scoundrelly Pardoner finds in the death of Attila an anecdote to illustrate the evil of drunkenness:"
TEXT_POEM,"Looke, Attila, the gretë conqueróur,"
TEXT_POEM,"Deyde in his sleepe, with shame and dishonóur,"
TEXT_POEM,Bledynge ay at his nose in dronkenesse;
TEXT_POEM,A capitayn sholde lyve in sobrenesse.
TEXT_EXTRA,"But a chronicler named Marcellinus Comes, writing in Constantinople at about the same time as Jordanes, knew a different story: Attila was stabbed in the night by a woman. It may well be that this story originated almost as soon as the true report – it was lying ready to hand."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In very brief remarks on this matter, my father sketched out his view of the further evolution of the Burgundian legend when the story that Attila was murdered by his bride had taken root. Such a deed must have a motive, and no motive is more likely than that it was vengeance for the murder of the bride’s father, or kinsmen. Attila had come to be seen as the leader of the Huns in the massacre of the Burgundians in 437 (see p.341); now, the murder was done in vengeance for the destruction of Gundahari and his people. Whether or not Ildico was a Burgundian, her rôle in the evolving drama must make her so. And she avenges her brother, Gundahari."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The essential features of the Burgundian story are then present. Gundahari-Gunnar, vin Borgunda, was killed by Attila-Atli, and for this he was murdered, in his bed, by a woman. And the woman was Gudrún. But where the gold came from is of course a different question."
TEXT_EXTRA,"As the story of the Burgundians evolved it became intertwined with a legend (or legends) distinct in nature and origin: the dragon-slayer and his golden hoard, and the mysterious Nibelungs (German Nibelungen, Norse Niflungar). When that conjunction and combination took place cannot be said, but it seems plain that it was made in Germany, and not in Scandinavia."
TEXT_EXTRA,"This is a matter that raises many questions that cannot be certainly resolved, and its study has been marked by severe disagreements. My father took a deep interest in it; but in his lectures at Oxford he approached it primarily from his desire to convey an idea of the largely vanished heroic poetry of ancient England. Since in this book my object is to present his poems expressly in terms of his own beliefs and opinions, it seems best to introduce this sketch of the subject in the same way, with the same question: what can be learned of it from the scraps and fragmentary references of Old English poetry?"
TEXT_EXTRA,"In fact, there is only one text from which to look for an answer to that question, namely, a passage in Beowulf. I give this passage here in my father’s translation of the poem, which he made, I incline to think, at some time not far distant from that in which he wrote the Lay of the Völsungs and the Lay of Gudrún."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Returning from their riding from the hall of Heorot to see the mere into which Grendel had plunged dying, the knights were entertained by a minstrel of the king."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"At whiles a servant of the king, a man laden with proud memories who had lays in mind and recalled a host and multitude of tales of old – word followed word, each truly linked to each – this man in his turn began with skill to treat in poetry the quest of Beowulf and in flowing verse to utter his ready tale, interweaving words."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"He recounted all that he had heard tell concerning Sigemund’s works of prowess, many a strange tale, the arduous deeds of the Wælsing and his adventures far and wide, deeds of vengeance and of enmity, things that the children of men knew not fully, save only Fitela who was with him. In those days he was wont to tell something of such matters to his sister’s child, even as they ever were comrades in need in every desperate strait – many and many of the giant race had they laid low with swords. For Sigemund was noised afar after his dying day no little fame, since he, staunch in battle, had slain the serpent, the guardian of the Hoard. Yea he, the son of noble house, beneath the hoar rock alone did dare the perilous deed. Fitela was not with him; nonetheless it was his fortune that the sword pierced through the serpent of strange shape and stood fixed in the wall, goodly blade of iron; the dragon died a cruel death. The fierce slayer had achieved by his valour that he might at his own will enjoy that hoard of rings; the boat upon the sea he laded and bore to the bosom of his ship the bright treasures, the offspring of Wæls was he. The serpent melted in its heat."
TEXT_CONTEXT,"He was far and wide of adventurers the most renowned throughout the people of mankind for his works of prowess, that prince of warriors – thereby did he aforetime prosper – after the valour and might of Heremod, his might and prowess, had failed..."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The remainder of the passage concerns the Danish king Heremod and does not bear on the question at issue here. In a lecture on the subject my father set down what he called ‘preliminary points’ – considerations arising from the Old English evidences alone, without looking further afield. In what follows I give them in abbreviated form but almost entirely in his own words."
TEXT_STORY,"There cannot be any serious doubt that the reference in Beowulf is to a story related to the Völsung and Nibelung legends of other lands. The names Sigemund, Wælsing, Fitela (and his relation nefa to eam [nephew to uncle] of Sigemund), and the dragon with his hoard, must on grounds of philology and legend be ultimately the same as Old Norse Sigmundr son of Völsung, with his sister-son Sin-fjötli. This remains true in spite of the serious discrepancies: e.g. that Sigemund (not his son: no hint of whose existence is given) slew the dragon; or that a boat, not a horse, is the vehicle for the treasure."
TEXT_STORY,"The Burgundians are not referred to at all in Beowulf. Neither are many, certainly renowned, figures of Germanic story. The argument from silence is peculiarly perilous in dealing with remnants so haphazard and tattered as those we possess of Old English heroic traditions; and might seem absurd when applied to Beowulf, which is a poem, not a catalogue. Yet it actually has some point in this case. The Burgundian names were known to Old English, and the subjects of verse and tale. We cannot be certain that such a connexion was not present to the mind of the author of Beowulf. But it does not look like it."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The Burgundians are indeed known. But where we meet them in Old English, we find an exact reversal of the case in Beowulf. No reference, at any rate, is made to their connexion with Sigemund Wælsing. The very early poem Widsith reveals a wide-flung interest in a huge nexus of legend: admittedly, specially devoted to the Goths or the northern sea-peoples, but it is not silent on more southern Germanic topics. It refers to Guðhere and to Gifica. It does not refer at all to Sigemund, or Wælsing, or Fitela, or the dragon. (Widsith has indeed a specially historical tendency.)"
TEXT_EXTRA,"Certain reference to the ‘Wælsingas’ is indeed in Old English literature confined to Beowulf. [My father added ‘literature’ on account of the place-name Walsingham in Norfolk.] If we add to this the absence in nomenclature of the special names peculiar to this story in its full-grown form (Guðrún, Grímhild, Brynhild) we shall be forced at the outset to conclude that it is probable:"
TEXT_EXTRA,"that Sigemund Wælsing had no pre-eminent place in Old English traditions, in spite of the words wreccena mærost used of him in Beowulf [in the translation given above ‘of adventurers the most renowned’], which may be no more than poetic for ‘a famous adventurer’;"
TEXT_EXTRA,that his tale from the earliest times was of the more mythical-legendary kind – not one of the historical-legendary traditions;
TEXT_EXTRA,"that it was not concerned with Burgundians, who certainly were originally figures of history, but with the dark background of the story that in High German had practically faded out of memory: the part that in Old Norse (though remodelled and drastically altered) concerns the mysterious Odinic Völsungs before the advent of Sigurd. The names are Sigemund, Fitela, Wælsing: these we can find trace of (even outside Beowulf ). The names – women’s names especially – which mark the vital connexion with the Burgundians and their fall cannot be discovered in Old English times in Old English form."
TEXT_EXTRA,"These are only probable considerations. But they are important even so. For the tone, manner, and details of the Old English references are peculiarly important. In general we are likely to get in Old English allusions to an earlier state in legendary development, before the confusion or combinations of later days in other lands. It is therefore vital to note that the most reasonable interpretation of Old English material is that the Sigemund story was originally of an older more mythical type; that it co-existed with the Burgundian legend, but was not yet connected with it."
TEXT_STORY,"The major problem raised by the passage in Beowulf in its relation to the Norse story as it appears in the Völsunga Saga is of course the fact that in Beowulf Sigemund is famed for his slaying of a dragon and the gaining of its treasure hoard, whereas in Norse Sigmund has nothing to do with any dragon, and it is Sigmund’s son Sigurd who is the famous dragon-slayer. Some scholars have held that Sigemund’s dragon in Beowulf originally belonged to Sigurd, but was transferred to Sigemund when the two came to be linked as father and son. Others have said that there is no reason to suppose that the author of the Old English poem had ever heard of Sigurd. Some have said that Sigemund and Sigurd were originally wholly independent heroes; others, that one hero became divided into two."
TEXT_EXTRA,"My father accepted that his view was necessarily speculative, but nonetheless favoured it strongly."
TEXT_EXTRA,‘We cannot tell if Old English knew of a famous son of Sigemund. But in favour of the highly probable answer “it did not” are these considerations.
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘In the first place, great heroes (wreccena maerost), especially if untrammelled by history, are apt to generate sons who carry on or duplicate their father’s deeds, to satisfy the desire for more, or to introduce new elements, or to link with other tales."
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘In the second place, no such son is anywhere mentioned in Old English."
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘And in the third place, when such a son appears, his function is solely to connect with and become a chief character in the Burgundian story, to bring the gold into it – and where he exists he has his father’s dragon and gold exploits attached to him. But in Old English these are not yet detached from Sigemund.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"My father did not discuss in his lecture notes other and strongly divergent opinions on this subject, apart from some remarks on the view that Sigemund’s dragon in Beowulf is a dragon of a very different sort from Sigurd’s, and that in fact they were unconnected. ‘But it is a dragon,’ he wrote. ‘And dragons are not common as essential actors in Germanic stories – in spite of the impression given by their being prominent in the Völsung stories and Beowulf. It is highly unlikely – however different in detail – that there should be no connexion between Sigemund’s wyrm and Fáfnir."
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘This of course is immeasurably strengthened if we believe that in order to connect with the Guðhere (Gundahari, Gunnar) stories a son was given to Sigemund (naturally his name begins with Sige-), but that this stage, presumably reached in Low or High Germany first, was not reached in Old English (which probably drew from archaic sources, and did not reflect the state of the legend contemporarily in Scandinavia and Germany about the year 800 or later).’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"He thought also that the origin of the re-forging of the great sword Gram (Gramr) – carried by both father and son – is to be found here. The fact that the second element in the son’s name is not constant seemed to be significant. In Old Norse he is Sigurðr, derived from a deduced earlier form Sigiwarð, in Old English Sigeweard, later Siward; whereas the German name is quite distinct: Siegfried (Sîfrit) corresponds to an Old English Sigefriþ. That the element mund in the father’s name is constant points, he thought, to its being the older form."
TEXT_EXTRA,"His belief that, as he said, we are in the presence of the duplication of a hero and his marvellous sword of strange origin – as opposed to the view that the father and the son were once entirely distinct and unconnected beings – leads to the conception, in his words, of a legendary hero of supreme valour and beauty, whose name began with the element Sige- ‘victory’. The gleaming eyes of Sigurd (the Lay of the Völsungs VIII.29, IX.26,59) are probably an original trait. In all probability his most renowned exploits concerned a dragon and a hoard, and – possibly – a mysterious, half-supernatural bride."
TEXT_STORY,"Questions fundamental to the genesis of the legend are how it came about that the ‘Dragon-hero’ intruded into the story of Attila and the Burgundians, why the treasure-hoard of this hero was called the Hoard of the Nibelungs, and why the Burgundians themselves came to be called the Nibelungs. In the only lecture-notes of my father’s on these matters, or at any rate in the only ones that survive, he indicated his own views very briefly (and not at all points in a way easy to interpret), no doubt because his primary concern was with the Sigemund passage in Beowulf. I shall not therefore enter into any close account of the numerous attempts to solve these baffling and tantalizing questions, but do no more than sketch out some essential aspects. I have also of necessity avoided reference to the German tradition, represented primarily by the Nibelungenlied, except where its evidence is essential even within these limits."
TEXT_EXTRA,"A widely held but by no means unchallenged theory rests upon the interpretation of the name Nibelung (Niflung) as etymologically related to a group of Germanic words meaning ‘darkness’ or ‘mist’ (modern German retains the word Nebel ‘mist’). This is brought into connection with certain things said about the Nibelungs. Snorri Sturluson said of the grandsons of King Gjúki that they were ‘black as a raven in the colour of their hair, like Gunnar and Högni and the other Niflungar’; and in a much earlier (ninth century) poem they are called hrafnbláir ‘raven-black’: in the Lay of the Völsungs (VII.10) it is said: ‘As ravens dark were those raven-friends’."
TEXT_EXTRA,"An essential element in this theory is the figure of Högni, as he appears in German tradition. In the Nibelungenlied his name is Hagen, and he is not the brother of the Burgundians but their kinsman and vassal. Ferocious and cruel, hating Siegfried and indeed his murderer, he is very unlike the Norse Högni. In the Thiðrekssaga, a large compilation made in Norway, in Bergen, about the middle of the 13th century, but based on stories then current in North Germany, Högni, as he is named in this work, is the half-brother of the Burgundians, for a fairy or incubus slept with his mother, and the offspring of the union was Högni. In the Thiðrekssaga his appearance is troll-like, and he is said to have been all over dark, with black hair and black beard. Especially notable is the fact that the name Hagen/ Högni does not alliterate on G, showing that he did not originally belong to the Burgundian clan at all."
TEXT_EXTRA,"An important evidence appears at the beginning of the Nibelungenlied. When Siegfried arrived at the Burgundian court at Worms Hagen looked down from a window at the magnificent knight who had ridden in with a fine company; and guessing who it was he told King Gunther a story concerning a great exploit of Sigurd. With the air of a casual insertion, Hagen’s story is briefly reported in the poem in a very obscure fashion, and I will refer here only to features essential for this purpose."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Siegfried was one day riding alone past a mountain, and he came upon many men gathered round a huge treasure which they had carried out of a cavern. For reasons that are not clearly explained Siegfried came into conflict with ‘the bold Nibelungs’, the two princes named Nibelung and Schilbung, and slew them, and their friends. He fought also with a dwarf named Alberich, and subdued him, but did not kill him: he had the hoard taken back into the cavern whence it had come, and made Alberich the guardian of the treasure. He was now the lord of ‘Nibelungeland’, the possessor of the great hoard, and for the rest of the first part of the Nibelungenlied he has the support of warriors from Nibelungeland, who are called Nibelungs. But in the second part of the German poem, which is held to rest on a quite different poetic source, the name ‘Nibelungs’ is applied, very strangely and on a first reading of the poem most disturbingly, in a totally different sense: it now means the Burgundians, just as it does in Norse."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Hagen also knew, and told this to Gunther, that Siegfried had slain a dragon and bathed in its blood, from which his skin grew so horny that no weapon would bite it. But this is in no way associated with the Nibelung hoard."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In the Nibelungenlied the hoard is associated with a dwarf, and a cavern in a mountain. What is the significance of the Dwarves?"
TEXT_EXTRA,"In Norse mythology we are confronted, in the mythological poems of the Edda and also in Snorri Sturluson’s treatise, with a great many scattered hints and observations about the minor beings of the immensely rich and many-peopled heathen supernatural world. Taken all together it is baffling; and beyond question there was once a whole world of thought and belief concerning these beings which is now almost totally lost. However, bearing in mind that Snorri was writing in the thirteenth century and that behind him stretch century upon century of unrecorded, various and shifting beliefs, we may notice what he says: which is, that there are the Light Elves, Ljósálfar, and the Dark Elves, Dökkálfar. The Light Elves dwell in a glorious place called Álfheimr (Elf-home, Elf-world), but the Dark Elves ‘live down in the earth, and they are unlike the Light Elves in appearance, but much more unlike in nature. The Light Elves are fairer to look upon than the sun, but the Dark Elves are blacker than pitch.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"So far as we can now tell, there seems little difference between the Scandinavian Dark Elves, black as pitch and living underground, and the Dvergar, Dwarves; in fact Snorri more than once refers to Dwarves as inhabitants of Svartálfaheimr, the Land of the Dark Elves. The Dwarf Andvari, original owner of Fáfnir’s treasure, dwelt, according to Snorri, in the Land of the Dark Elves (see the commentary on the Lay of the Völsungs, p.189): there he kept his hoard within a rock, and there Loki caught him."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Characteristics of the Dwarves in Old Norse literature may be briefly mentioned. They are above all master-craftsmen, the makers of marvellous treasures and wonderful weapons. The most renowned objects in the Norse myths were made by Dwarves: Ódin’s spear Gungnir, Thór’s hammer Mjöllnir, and Skíðblaðnir, the ship of the God Freyr, which could carry all the Gods, yet was made so intricately that it could be folded up like a napkin and put in a pouch."
TEXT_EXTRA,"Dwarves lived always underground or inside rocks (an echo was called dverg-mál, ‘dwarf-talk’); and they possessed vast knowledge. If caught in the open after sunrise they were turned to stone. There is a poem in the Edda, the Alvíssmál, in which the God Thór asks many questions of a Dwarf named Allvíss (‘All-wise’); and Thór kept him answering his questions so long that the sun came up. The poem ends with Thór crying: ‘Dwarf, you are uppi dagaðr’, you are ‘dayed up’, the sun has caught you."
TEXT_STORY,"The train of thought that emerges from all this will be clear, and the conclusion. Dark Elves, black as pitch, and Dwarves, closely related in Norse mythology if not identical, guardians of treasure in caverns and rocks; Alberich and Andvari; the origin of the Nibelung name in connection with ‘darkness’ words; Hagen’s ‘elvish’ birth, his dark and troll-like appearance in Thiðrekssaga. On this theory, this is what the Nibelungs originally were: they were beings of darkness, Dark Elves or Dwarves, and Siegfried/Sigurd stole their great treasure from them."
TEXT_STORY,"This ‘mythological’ theory, or some form of it, is radically challenged by other scholars. From place-names and personal names in the region of Burgundian settlement there is evidence that is interpreted to mean that Nibelung was the name of a powerful Burgundian family or clan. Putting the matter in its simplest form, it is supposed on this basis that the (purely human) Nibelung clan of Burgundia either possessed very great wealth in historical fact, or else very early had it attributed to them; and ‘the hoard of the Nibelungs’ was the family treasure of the Burgundian kings."
TEXT_STORY,"That my father subscribed to the ‘mythological’ theory in some form is plain; but his view of the process by which the Burgundians became Nibelungs is nowhere clearly or fully expressed in his writings. He had suggested (see this Appendix p.341) that the connection of the ‘Dragon-hero’ with the Burgundian king Gundahari began with ‘gold’ as a motive to explain Attila’s attack (when Attila had become the leader of the Huns in the destruction of the Burgundian kingdom of Worms). As Gundahari faded back into the past (he wrote), old legends of fairy-hoards localized on the Rhine naturally became attached to the famous king in Worms: ‘this treasure probably had demon or dwarvish guardians already, but need not originally have been the same as Sigemund’s gold, though it may well have been.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘It would certainly seem’, he said, ‘that the gold-hero who intrudes into the Burgundians had already gathered round him enemy Niflungar, who robbed him of life, bride, and treasure. The historical Burgundians partly take their place, and though there is never complete fusion they are darkened.’ He also saw it as virtually certain that the Nibelungenlied is the more original ‘in making the demonic and cruel Hagen not a brother, but an associate vaguely connected with the Burgundians. Very likely Hagen/Högni is a relic of some old mythical figure connected originally with the gold, or at any rate with the mythical pre-Burgundian part of the “Sigurd” story.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"From observations such as these in his notes one can perhaps surmise that my father saw the genesis of the central part of the legend after this fashion. The Dragon-hero was already the robber of the Hoard of the dark, demonic Nibelungs (whom my father expressly saw as ‘the original owners’), and he brought with him into the Burgundian legend the story of how the Nibelungs in revenge slew him, and took the treasure."
TEXT_EXTRA,"With the fusion of the two legends, the Burgundian princes necessarily became his enemies: he must be killed in order that they should become the possessors of the gold, and they drew into themselves, so to speak, something of the dark Nibelung nature. It was from the ‘Nibelung’ side of the composite legend that the ‘demonic and cruel’ Hagen ultimately came, with (in the Nibelungenlied) his lust for the gold and his guarding it to the death, his relentless hatred of Siegfried leading to his murder. Hagen became more or less assimilated to the Burgundians, and in the Norse (as Högni) wholly so; but the Burgundians on their side became Nibelungs, or Niflungar."
TEXT_EXTRA,"My father also surmised that the demonic bride was part of the complex of legend that was brought in with the Dragon-hero into the Burgundian story; and that when he brought with him his enemies the Nibelungs, they came not only as the robbers of his life and the treasure, but also of his betrothed. ‘It seems probable,’ he said, ‘that the robbing of Sigurd of his bride by the Niflungar is part of the old legendary plot that was handed over to the Burgundians. And the Valkyrie-bride has all along retained too much that is fierce and inhuman about her for completely successful treatment.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"Thus, finally, the hoard of which Sigurd was robbed became (by a curious irony) the Hoard of the Nibelungs (as it had always been); for the Burgundians were now the Nibelungs. And Gunnar acquired the Valkyrie."

TEXT_EXTRA,"I include this poem by my father in rhyming couplets as a companion to the altogether distinct Upphaf to the Lay of the Völsungs, since it also was inspired by the Eddaic poem Völuspá (see the commentary on the Lay, pp.183–84)."

CHAPTER_NUMBER,APPENDIX C
CHAPTER_NAME,FRAGMENTS OF A HEROIC POEM OF ATTILA IN OLD ENGLISH
TEXT_EXTRA,"These verses in the old English alliterative metre were composed at some date unknown, but I think it at least very probable that they belong to the same period as all the writings in this book, my father’s earlier years at Oxford after his departure from Leeds."
TEXT_EXTRA,"In content and internal sequence both pieces are closely based on the Old Norse Atlakviða. There is more than one copy of each, with minor progressive improvement. In each case I have appended a translation and a few explanatory notes."
UNKNOWN(fm-1),I
TEXT_EXTRA,"This text corresponds to the first eight stanzas of Atlakviða. It is a part of the Norse poem that poses many difficulties and doubts; and it seems conceivable that my father selected it precisely because it is the beginning of the poem, as if at one time he thought to transform it in this way in its entirety. For the corresponding passage in the Lay of Gudrún see pp.265–67, stanzas 37–44."

TEXT_EXTRA,"1 Ætla, Guðhere: the Old English forms of the Norse names Atli and Gunnar."
TEXT_EXTRA,"2 Cnéofrið: the name of Atli’s messenger in Atlakviða is Knefröðr: see the commentary on the Lay of Gudrún, stanzas 37–48."
TEXT_EXTRA,"3 Gifeca: the Old English form of the Norse name Gjúki, father of Gunnar: see Appendix A, p.340."
TEXT_EXTRA,"5–6 In a lecture on the text of Atlakviða my father took the meaning of the verse at this point to be that there was merriment in the hall among Gunnar’s folk, but the Hunnish envoys sat silent, hiding their thoughts. But his Old English verses may not proceed from this interpretation."
TEXT_EXTRA,"The Old English word melda means one who declares, tells, informs, or betrays. The man in Beowulf who stole the goblet from the dragon’s hoard and led Beowulf and his companions to the lair is called a melda. But I do not know what significance my father gave to the word in this verse."
TEXT_EXTRA,11 Wistlawudu. This name occurs in the poem Widsith:
TEXT_POEM,"ful oft þær wig ne alæg,"
TEXT_POEM,þonne Hræda here heardum sweordum
TEXT_POEM,ymb Wistlawudu wergan sceoldon
TEXT_POEM,ealdne eþelstol Ætlan leodum.
TEXT_EXTRA,"‘Seldom was warfare stilled, when the host of the Hrædas [Goths] about the Vistula forest had to defend with their swords their ancient dwelling-place from the people of Attila.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"The reference to Wistlawudu is a vestige of very ancient tradition; for it was about the end of the second century that the Goths departed on a vast south-easterly migration from the Baltic coast and the Vistula valley, and at length settled in the plains to the north of the Black Sea. But in Widsith ‘the Vistula forest’ is thought of as the primeval forest separating the territories of the Goths and the Huns, and is to be equated with Myrkviðr (see the commentary on the Lay of the Völsungs, VII.14 (pp.227–28): in Atlakviða Knefröðr says that he had ridden through Myrkvið inn ókunna, Mirkwood unexplored."
TEXT_EXTRA,"20 Ætla’s offer (following Atlakviða) of ‘Gnitanheath’, where Fáfnir had his lair, as if it were a part of his dominion constitutes a problem to which a number of solutions have been proposed. My father thought it probable that there was an ancient association of Gnitaheiðr with a gold hoard, of which we know nothing, and that this caused it to be attracted to Fáfnir, that is, became later the name of the region where he had his lair and his treasure. I cannot account for the form Gnitanheath."
TEXT_EXTRA,"27 The word runbora seems not to be recorded in Old English, but I take it to mean ‘one who bears run’ in the sense of ‘(secret) counsel’, hence ‘counsellor’, equivalent to the recorded word rædbora of the same meaning."
TEXT_EXTRA,36 Hagena: Högni.
TEXT_EXTRA,37 weargloccum ‘wolf’s hair’: in Old English the word wearg was used exclusively of an outlaw or hunted criminal but Norse vargr retained in addition the sense ‘wolf’. From this was derived the name of the Wargs of Middle-earth.
TEXT_EXTRA,"39 The word hæðstapa ‘heath-roamer’ occurs in Beowulf, where it is used of a stag. In Atlakviða the word used is heiðingi, of similar meaning: see the commentary on the Lay of Gudrún, stanzas 37–48, where the verse in the Norse poem is cited."
UNKNOWN(fm-1),II
TEXT_EXTRA,"This second text corresponds to verses much further on in Atlakviða, beginning at stanza 24, Hló þá Högni... ‘Then Högni laughed...’ The passage in the Lay of Gudrún is stanzas 127–130."
TEXT_EXTRA,"After line 19 my father evidently rejected a passage from his poem, since it is not repeated in the finished copy. The Old English poem takes up again, and concludes, with Atlakviða stanza 32, Lifanda gram..., ‘the living prince...’"

TEXT_EXTRA,"4 gar-niflung. In earlier forms of this passage my father wrote gimneoflung here, at line 12 hord Neoflunga, and at line 17 Ealdneoflunga. I cannot account for these forms of the name, but in any case in the final text he returned to Niflung, Niflunga. In the earlier forms (only) he wrote the word gar ‘spear’ against gim ‘jewel’ in gimneoflung; but since the verse in Atlakviða has Mærr kvað þat Gunnarr, geir-Niflungr (‘Glorious Gunnar spoke, the spear-Niflung’) I have adopted this."
TEXT_EXTRA,6 Hella: in Atlakviða and in the Lay of Gudrún the name of the thrall is Hjalli.
TEXT_EXTRA,"17 entiscum yrfe. This puzzling line depends on a very debatable verse in Atlakviða, in which the word áskunna ‘of divine race’ precedes arfi Niflunga ‘the heritage of the Niflungs’. In his comments on this my father seems to have favoured áskunna Niflunga ‘the Niflungs of divine race’, while admitting that it is not clear what was meant by this, rather than taking it with arfi, saying that ‘it is very dubious if one can speak of a hoard as being “of divine race”.’"
TEXT_EXTRA,"In his Old English version he wrote first here óscund yrfe (where óscund means ‘of divine race, divine’, the word ós being the etymological equivalent of Norse áss, plural æsir), then changed it to the adjective entisc (and subsequently entiscum) ‘giant, of giants’ from the noun ent (from which was derived the name of the Ents of Middle-earth). In a subsequent copy he wrote óscund in the margin against entisc, as if still uncertain."
