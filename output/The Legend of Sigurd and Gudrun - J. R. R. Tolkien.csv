Tolkien,,,,TEXT_CONTEXT,"I had very little desire to look for buried treasure or fight pirates, and Treasure Island left me cool. Red Indians were better: there were bows and arrows (I had and have a wholly unsatisfied desire to shoot well with a bow), and strange languages, and glimpses of an archaic mode of life, and above all, forests in such stories. But the land of Merlin and Arthur were better than these, and best of all the nameless North of Sigurd and the Völsungs, and the prince of all dragons. Such lands were pre-eminently desirable.",,,

The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun - J. R. R. Tolkien,THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRÚN,,,BY J.R.R. Tolkien,,,,TEXT_EXTRA,"Many years ago my father referred to the words of William Morris concerning what he called ‘the Great Story of the North’, which, he insisted, should be to us ‘what the Tale of Troy was to the Greeks’, and which far in the future ‘should be to those that come after us no less than the Tale of Troy has been to us.’ On this my father observed: ‘How far off and remote sound now the words of William Morris! The Tale of Troy has been falling into oblivion since that time with surprising rapidity. But the Völsungs have not taken its place.’",,,

Tolkien,,,,TEXT_EXTRA,"The poetry that goes by this misleading and unfortunate title attracts occasionally from afar people of various sort – philologists, historians, folklorists, and others of that kidney, but also poets, critics, and connoisseurs of new literary sensations. The philologists (in a wide sense) have as usual done most of the work, and their ardour has not more than usual (probably less than in Beowulf ) been diverted from at least intelligent appreciation of the literary value of these documents.",,,
The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun - J. R. R. Tolkien,THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRÚN,,,BY J.R.R. Tolkien,,,,TEXT_STORY,"Let none who listen to the poets of the Elder Edda go away imagining that he has listened to voices of the Primitive Germanic forest, or that in the heroic figures he has looked upon the lineaments of his noble if savage ancestors – such as fought by, with, or against the Romans. I say this with all possible emphasis – and yet so powerful is the notion of hoary and primeval antiquity which clings to the name (quite recent) Elder Edda in popular fancy (so far as popular fancy may be said to play with so remote and unprofitable a theme at all) that, though the tale ought to begin with the seventeenth century and a learned bishop, insensibly I find myself leading off with the Stone Age.",,,
The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun - J. R. R. Tolkien,THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRÚN,,,BY J.R.R. Tolkien,,,,TEXT_STORY,"Yet the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, at the darkest hour, saw a resurrection after Ragnarök, almost as if there were fulfilled in it the words which the Völva [the sibyl who prophesies in the Eddaic poem Völuspá] speaks concerning the rearising of a new earth, and the return of men and gods to find and marvel at the golden pieces in the grass where once were the halls in which the gods had played at chess [see the tenth verse of the poem The Prophecy of the Sibyl given in Appendix B].",,,
The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun - J. R. R. Tolkien,THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRÚN,,,BY J.R.R.

It contains 29 poems. There are 45 leaves of it left. After leaf 32 a gathering, probably of eight pages, has been lost.* There appear to have been no losses at beginning and end – where losses frequently occur.",,,
The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun - J. R. R. Tolkien,THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRÚN,,,BY J.R.R. Tolkien,,,,TEXT_STORY,"This is all we know about this remarkable survivor of time, fire, and flood. In 1662 King Frederick III of Denmark sent the well-known Thormod Torfæus with an open letter to the celebrated Brynjólfr Sveinsson. Since 1639 Brynjólfr had been bishop of Skálaholt in Iceland, and had been a keen collector of manuscripts. Torfæus was commissioned to get his help in collecting for the king materials for ancient history, and any antiquities, curiosities, or rarities that could be found in Iceland. In 1663 the bishop sent the choicest of his collection to the king. Among these now priceless treasures was the Codex Regius. Where the bishop had found it, or what was its previous history is unknown, except that he had picked it up twenty years earlier: for on the front page he had written his monogram and a date (LL 1643, i.e. Lupus Loricatus = Brynjólfr), just as we should scrawl our name and a date on a new and interesting acquisition from a second-hand bookshop.",,,

Tolkien,§1 THE ‘PROSE EDDA’ OF SNORRI STURLUSON,,,TEXT_EXTRA,"The name Edda properly belongs only to a celebrated work by the Icelander Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241). This is a treatise on the distinctive art of Icelandic poetry which in Snorri’s day was dying out: the old metrical rules disregarded, the old mythological knowledge essential to it attacked by a clergy hostile to any survival of heathendom. This book, in its three parts, is a retelling in prose narrative of ancient myths and legends; an account of, and explanation of, the strange diction of the old ‘court poetry’; and exemplification of its verse-forms.",,,

The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun - J. R. R. Tolkien,THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRÚN,,,BY J.R.R. Tolkien,§1 THE ‘PROSE EDDA’ OF SNORRI STURLUSON,,,TEXT_STORY,"It remains to add that the celebrity of Snorri’s book in the centuries that followed, and most especially of the Skáldskaparmál, led, before the emergence of the Codex Regius, to the term Edda being widely used to mean, expressly, the technical rules of the old ‘court’ poetry, or ‘Skaldic’ verse. In those days poets complained of the tyranny of Edda, or offered apologies for their lack of proficiency in the art of Edda. In the words of Gudbrand Vigfússon: ‘An untaught poet who called a spade a spade, instead of describing it by a mythological circumlocution, would be scouted as “Eddaless”’ (Eddu-lauss, ‘having no Eddaic art’). Thus the term ‘Eddaic’, as now used, in opposition to ‘Skaldic’, is a perfect reversal of its former meaning.",,,

Tolkien,§2 THE SAGA OF THE VÖLSUNGS (Völsunga Saga),,,TEXT_EXTRA,"The Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda is a collection of poems of great diversity, composed by poets who lived centuries apart; but it was compiled and ordered with intelligent care. Most of the heroic poems are concerned with the story of the Völsungs and the Niflungs; and these the compiler of the collection arranged, so far as the diverse structure and scope of the individual lays allowed him, in a narrative sequence, adding explanatory passages in prose at the beginning and end of many of the lays, and narrative links in the course of them.",,,
The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun - J. R. R. Tolkien,THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRÚN,,,BY J.R.R. Tolkien,§2 THE SAGA OF THE VÖLSUNGS (Völsunga Saga),,,TEXT_STORY,"In this situation, there is an essential aid to the understanding of the Northern legend. This is the Völsunga Saga, written, probably in Iceland, in the thirteenth century, though the oldest manuscript is much later: a prose tale of the fate of the whole Völsung race from the far ancestry of Sigmund, father of Sigurd, and continuing on to the fall of the Niflungs and the death of Atli (Attila) and beyond. It is founded both on Eddaic lays that survive and other sources now lost; and ‘it is solely from the lays that it has used,’ my father said in a lecture, ‘that it derives its power and the attraction that it has for all those who come to it,’ for he did not hold the author’s artistic capacity in high regard.",,,
The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun - J. R. R. Tolkien,THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRÚN,,,BY J.R.R.

The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun - J. R. R. Tolkien,THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRÚN,,,BY J.R.R. Tolkien,§4 THE SPELLING OF NORSE NAMES,,,TEXT_STORY,"The only case where I have imposed consistency is that of the name of the god who in Norse is Óðinn. In his lecture notes my father naturally used the Norse form (which I have retained in the text of his lecture on the ‘Elder Edda’, p.22). In the carefully written manuscript of the ‘New Lays’, on the other hand, he ‘anglicized’ it, changing ð to d, but (as generally in all such cases) retaining the acute accent indicating a long vowel. But he used two forms, favouring one or the other in different parts of the Lay of the Völsungs: Ódin and Ódinn. But in section VI, Brynhildr, where the name occurs frequently in the form Ódinn, he wrote (stanza 8) Ódinn bound me, Ódin’s chosen. This is because in the Norse genitive nn changes to ns: Óðins sonr, ‘son of Ódin’.",,,

The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun - J. R. R. Tolkien,THE LEGEND OF SIGURD AND GUDRÚN,,,BY J.R.R. Tolkien,§5 THE VERSE-FORM OF THE POEMS,,,TEXT_STORY,"These are the normal patterns of four elements into which Old English words naturally fell, and into which modern English words still fall. They can be found in any passage of prose, ancient or modern. Verse of this kind differs from prose, not in re-arranging words to fit a special rhythm, repeated or varied in successive lines, but in choosing the simpler and more compact word-patterns and clearing away extraneous matter, so that these patterns stand opposed to one another.",,,

Tolkien,§5 THE VERSE-FORM OF THE POEMS,,,TEXT_EXTRA,"In the variations on the ‘basic patterns’ (‘overweighting’, ‘extension’, etc.) described in my father’s account there are indeed differences in Old Norse from Old English, tending to greater brevity; but I will enter only into the most radical and important difference between the verse-forms, namely, that all Norse poetry is ‘strophic’, or ‘stanzaic’, that is, composed in strophes or stanzas. This is in the most marked contrast to Old English, where any such arrangements were altogether avoided; and my father wrote of it (see p.7): ‘In Old English breadth, fullness, reflection, elegiac effect, were aimed at. Old Norse aims at seizing a situation, striking a blow that will be remembered, illuminating a moment with a flash of lightning – and tends to concision, weighty packing of the language in sense and form, and gradually to greater regularity of form of verse.’",,,

At Ódin’s right hand there walks another figure, a nameless shadow. It would seem that this poet (seeing that the Northern Gods represent but written large the ways of Men in the hostile world) has taken this old legend to symbolize Man’s prudence and wisdom and its ever present accompaniment of folly and malice that defeats it, only to bring forth greater heroism and deeper wisdom; while ever at the right hand walks the shadow that is neither Ódin nor Loki but in some aspect Fate, the real story that must be blended of both. Yet Ódin is master of the Three and the final outcome will resemble rather the hope of Ódin than the malice (shorter sighted) of Loki. Ódin at times gives expression to this, saying that his hope looks out beyond the seeming disasters of this world. Though Ódin’s chosen come all to an evil end or untimely death, that will only make them of greater worth for their ultimate purpose in the Last Battle. On this in many ways mysterious writing see the commentary on the Upphaf of the Lay of the Völsungs, and the commentary on the first section of the poem, Andvari’s Gold, stanza 1.",,,

In his introduction to lectures at Oxford on the Eddaic poem Guðrúnarkviða en forna, the Old Lay of Gudrún, he said that ‘curiously enough’ he was more interested in Gudrún, ‘who is usually slighted, and considered as of secondary interest’, than in Brynhild. By implication, he contrasted the long agony of Gudrún with the irruption of Brynhild, who soon departs, ‘and her passion and death remain only in the background of the tale, a brief and terrible storm beginning in fire and ending in it.’",,,

The falls of Andvari frothed and murmured with fish teeming in foaming pools. As a pike there plunged his prey hunting Dwarf Andvari from his dark cavern. There hunted hungry Hreidmar’s offspring: the silver salmon sweet he thought them. Otr in otter’s form there ate blinking, on the bank brooding of black waters. With stone struck him, stripped him naked, Loki lighthanded, loosing evil. The fell they flayed, fared then onward; in Hreidmar’s halls housing sought they. There wrought Regin by the red embers rune-written iron, rare, enchanted; of gold things gleaming, of grey silver, there Fáfnir lay by the fire dreaming. Hreidmar ‘Do fetters fret you, folk of Ásgard? Regin hath wrought them with runes binding. Redgolden rings, ransom costly, this fell must fill, this fur cover!’ Lightshod Loki over land and waves to Rán came running in her realm of sea. The queen of Ægir his quest granted: a net she knotted noosed with evil. Loki ‘What fish have I found in the flood leaping, rashly roaming? Ransom pay me!’ Loki ‘What hides thy hand thus hollow bending?’ (The Dwarf spake darkly from his delvéd stone:) In Hreidmar’s house they heaped the gold. Ódin ‘Ye gold have gained: a god’s ransom, for thyself and sons seed of evil.’ Words spake Loki worse thereafter: Ódin ‘Whom Ódin chooseth ends not untimely, though ways of men he walk briefly. In wide Valhöll he may wait feasting – it is to ages after that Ódin looks.’ Hreidmar ‘The hope of Ódin we heed little! Redgolden rings I will rule alone. Though Gods grudge it gold is healing.

Tolkien,ANDVARA-GULL,II SIGNÝ,,TEXT_POEM,"On the coasts of the North was king renowned Rerir sea-roving, the raven’s lord. Shield-hung his ships, unsheathed his sword; his sire of old was son of Ódin. Him Völsung followed valiant-hearted, child of longing, chosen of Ódin. Valkyrie fair did Völsung wed, Ódin’s maiden, Ódin’s chosen. Sigmund and Signý, a son and daughter, she bare at a birth in his builded halls. High rose their roofs, huge their timbers, and wide the walls of wood carven. A tree there towered tall and branching, that house upholding, the hall’s wonder; its leaves their hangings, its limbs rafters, its mighty bole in the midst standing. * Völsung ‘What sails be these in the seas shining? What ships be those with shields golden?’ Völsung ‘Wherefore grievous? Are guests hateful? Gautland’s master glorious reigneth.’ Birds sang blithely o’er board and hearth, bold men and brave on benches sitting. Mailclad, mighty, his message spake there a Gautish lord gleaming-harnessed. Gaut ‘Siggeir sent me swiftly steering: fame of Völsung far is rumoured. Signý’s beauty, Signý’s wisdom, to his bed he wooeth, bride most lovely.’ Völsung ‘What saith Sigmund? Shall his sister go with lord so mighty league to bind us?’ Ere summer faded sails came shining, ships came shoreward with shields gleaming. Many and mighty mailclad warriors to the seats of Völsung with Siggeir strode. Birds sang blissful over boards laden, over Signý pale, Siggeir eager. Dark wine they drank, doughty princes, Gautland’s chieftains; glad their voices. Wan night cometh; wind ariseth; doors are opened, the din is silenced. A man there enters, mantled darkly, hoary-bearded, huge and ancient. A sword he sweeps from swathing cloak, into standing stem stabs it swiftly: Doors clanged backward; din was wakened; men leapt forward mighty-handed. Gaut and Völsung glory seeking strove they starkly, straining vainly. Sigmund latest seized it lightly, the blade from bole brandished flaming. Siggeir yearning on that sword gazing red gold offered, ransom kingly. Sigmund ‘Though seas of silver and sands of gold thou bade in barter, thy boon were vain! To my hand made, for me destined, I sell no sword to Siggeir ever.’ * Signý ‘My heart is heavy my home leaving! Signý’s wisdom Signý burdens. From this wedding waketh woe and evil – break, sire, the bonds thou hast bound me in!’ Völsung ‘Woe and evil are woman’s boding! Fate none can flee. Faith man can hold. Ships await thee! Shame to sunder the bridal bed, the bounden word. Signý ‘Sigmund, farewell! Siggeir calls me. Weak might hath woman for wisdom’s load. Last night I lay where loath me was; with less liking I may lay me yet.’ ‘Hail! toft and Tree, timbers carven! Maid here was once who is mournful queen.’ Wild blew the wind waves white-crested. On land of Völsung she looked no more. * A ship came shining to shores foaming, gloomy Gautland’s guarded havens. Sigmund lordly, sire and kindred, to fair feasting fearless journeyed. Signý ‘Father Völsung, fairest kinsman! Back my brethren! This beach tread not! A bitter drinking, baleful meeting, swords hath Siggeir set to greet you.’ With thousand thanes, thronging spearmen, his guests welcomed Gautland’s master. Ten times Völsung towering wrathful casque and corslet clove asunder. Through and through them thrice went Sigmund; as grass in Gautland grimly mowed them. His shield he shed: with shining sword smoking redly slew two-handed. * Black the raven by the body croaketh, bare are Völsung’s bones once mighty. In bonds the brethren are bound living; Siggeir smileth, Signý weeps not. Signý ‘Sweet still is sight while see one may! A boon, my husband – bid men linger! Slay not swiftly seed of Völsung! For death is lasting, though the doom tarry.’ Siggeir ‘Wild and witless words of Signý, that pain and torment plead for kindred! Glad will I grant it, grimly bind them in the forest fettered, faint and hungry.’ In the forest fettered, faint and naked, her ten brethren torment suffered. There one by one a wolf rent them; by night after night another sought she. Signý ‘What found ye in the forest, my fair servants?’ * Signý ‘Who hath deeply delved this dark cavern? Dwarvish master, thy doors open!’ Brother and sister in a bed lying, brief love, bitter, blent with loathing! Answer, earth-dweller – in thy arms who lies, chill, enchanted, changed, elfshapen? Back went Signý to Siggeir’s hall, nine months brooding no word speaking. Wolves were wailing, her women shuddering, Signý silent, when a son she bore. * Sigmund ‘Who calls so clear at cavern’s doorway, fords so fearless the foaming stream? Fair one, thy father thy face gave not! What bringest bound in bast folded?’ Sinfjötli ‘My face is Völsung’s, father of Signý. Signý sent me a sword bearing. Long years it lay on the lap of Siggeir; Sigmund drew it, since hath no man.’ Thus son of Signý came Sinfjötli, to vengeance bred of Völsung slain. In the forest faring far in warfare long they laboured, long they waited. Wide they wandered wolvish-coated, men they murdered, men they plundered. Daylong slept they in dark cavern after dreadful deeds of death in Gautland. Moon was shining, men were singing, Siggeir sitting in his sounding hall. Völsung vanquished voices chanted; wolves came howling wild and dreadful. Doors were opened, din fell silent. Sigmund stood there his sword wielding, and Signý’s son at his side laughing. Sigmund ‘Come forth, Signý, sister fairest! Gautland’s glory grimly endeth. Glad the greeting, grief is over; avenged is Völsung valiant-hearted!’ Signý (Sigmund’s sister Signý answered:) ‘Son Sinfjötli, Sigmund father! Signý comes not, Siggeir calls her. Where I lay unwilling I now lay me glad; I lived in loathing, now lief I die.’ * Long ruled Sigmund, sire and uncle; Sinfjötli sat at his side proudly. There towered the tree, tall and ancient, birds in the branches were blithe again. Ever Grímnir’s gift gleamed in warfare; at Sigmund’s side Sinfjötli strode. Hard, handlinkéd, helm and corslet glasswhite glittered with grey silver. Seven kings they slew, their cities plundered; wide waxed their realm the world over. Of women fairest in war taken a wife took Sigmund; woe she brought him. Sinfjötli came sailing proudly ships goldladen to the shore steering. In came the queen evil pondering – her sire was slain by Sinfjötli – : Steep stands the horn, Stepson thirsty!’ Queen ‘Beer I bring thee brown and potent!’ Queen ‘Ale I offer thee, eager Völsung! Völsungs valiant at venom blench not; heroes ask not help in drinking – if drink thou darest, drink Sinfjötli!’ Dead Sinfjötli drinking stumbled. There sorrowladen Sigmund raised him, in arms caught him; out he wandered. Over wood and wild to the waves foaming witless strayed he to the waves roaring. Boatman ‘Whither bringest thou thy burden heavy? My boat is ready to bear it hence.’ A man there steered, mantled darkly, hooded and hoary, huge and awful. Alone was Sigmund by the land’s margin; in Valhöllu Völsung feasted: * Old was Sigmund, as an oak gnarléd; his beard was grey as bark of ash. Young was Sigrlinn and yellow-gleaming her locks hung long on lissom shoulder. Seven sons of kings sued the maiden: Sigmund took her; sails were hoisted. The Völsung land they viewed afar, the windy cliffs, the waves foaming. Sigmund ‘Say me, Sigrlinn, sweeter were it young king to wed and yellow-bearded, or wife of a Völsung, the World’s chosen in my bed to bear, bride of Ódin?’ * High sang the horns, helms were gleaming, shafts were shaken, shields them answered. Vikings’ standards, Völsung’s banner on strand were streaming; stern the onslaught. Old was Sigmund as the oak gnarléd; his sword swung he smoking redly. Fate him fended fearless striding with dew of battle dyed to shoulder. A warrior strange, one-eyed, awful, strode and stayed him standing silent, huge and hoary and hooded darkly. The sword of Sigmund sang before him. His spear he raised: sprang asunder the sword of Grímnir, singing splintered. The king is fallen cloven-breasted; lords lie round him; the land darkens. Men were moaning, the moon sinking. Sigrlinn sought him, sadly raised him: Sigmund ‘From wanhope many have been won to life, yet healing I ask not. Hope is needless. Ódin calls me at the end of days. Here lies not lost the last Völsung! Thy womb shall wax with the World’s chosen, serpent-slayer, seed of Ódin. Till ages end all shall name him chief of chieftains, changeless glory. Of Grímnir’s gift guard the fragments; of the shards shall be shaped a shining blade. Too soon shall I see Sigurd bear it to glad Valhöll greeting Ódin.’ Cold came morning o’er the king lifeless and woeful Sigrlinn her watch keeping. Ships came sailing to the shore crowding, rovers northern to the red beaches The bride of Sigmund as a bondwoman over sounding seas sadly journeyed. Wild blew the winds, waves them lifted; she viewed afar the Völsung land. Wind was wailing, waves were crying, Sigrlinn sorrowful, when a son she bore. Sigurd golden as a sun shining, forth came he fair in a far country. Woman ‘O woman woeful in war taken, who was thy husband while his house lasted? What father begot such fair offspring? – grey steel glitters in his gleaming eyes.’ Sigrlinn ‘The sire of Sigurd Sigmund Völsung; Seed of Ódin songs shall call him.’ *",,,

Here also are given the dark words of Regin in which the undermeaning is that the real cause of the serpent’s death is Regin, who should therefore have the gold (though this he has promised, at least in large share, to Sigurd); but that Regin should slay the slayer of his brother. Sigurd deeming him only weighed with the thought of his guilt in brother-murder, dismisses his words with scorn. Nor does Sigurd heed the dragon’s words concerning the curse, thinking them merely the device of greed to protect the gold even though its guardian be slain.

Tolkien,REGIN,V,,TEXT_POEM,"The forge was smoking in the forest-darkness; there wrought Regin by the red embers. There was Sigurd sent, seed of Völsung, lore deep to learn; long his fostering. Runes of wisdom then Regin taught him, and weapons’ wielding, works of mastery; the language of lands, lore of kingship, wise words he spake in the wood’s fastness. Regin ‘Full well couldst thou wield wealth and kingship, O son of Sigmund, a sire’s treasure.’ Regin ‘A hoard have I heard on a heath lying, gold more glorious than greatest king’s. Wealth and worship would wait on thee, if thou durst to deal with its dragon master.’ Sigurd ‘Men sing of serpents ceaseless guarding gold and silver greedy-hearted; but fell Fáfnir folk all name him of dragons direst, dreaming evil.’ Regin ‘Dragons all are dire to the dull-hearted; yet venom feared not Völsung’s children.’ * Regin ‘The falls of Andvari frothed and spouted with fish teeming in foaming pools. There Otr sported, mine own brother; to snare salmon sweet he thought it. With stone smote him, stripped him naked, a robber roving ruthless-handed; at Hreidmar’s house hailed my father, that fairest fell for food offered. There wrought Regin by the red embers rough iron hewing and runes marking; there Fáfnir lay by the fire sleeping, fell-hearted son, fiercely dreaming. (Hreidmar) “Redgolden rings, ransom costly, this fell must fill, this fur cover.” From the foaming force as a fish netted was Dwarf Andvari dragged and plundered. All must Andvari, all surrender, light rings and heavy, or life itself. In Hreidmar’s house heaped he laid them, gold ring on gold, a great weregild. (Regin & Fáfnir) “Shall not brethren share in brother’s ransom their grief to gladden? – gold is healing.” Then Fáfnir’s heart fiercely stung him; Hreidmar he hewed in his house asleep. Fáfnir’s heart as a fire burneth: part nor portion he pays to Regin. In dragon’s likeness darkling lies he; deep his dungeons, and dread he knows not. A helm of horror his head weareth on Gnitaheiði grimly creeping.’ Sigurd ‘With kin unkindly wert thou cursed Regin! His fire and venom affright me not! Yet why thou eggest me, I ask thee still – for father’s vengeance, or for Fáfnir’s gold?’ Regin ‘A sire avenged were sweet to Regin; the gold thy guerdon, the glory thine. A sword for Sigurd will the smith fashion, the blade most bitter ever borne to war.’ * The forge was smoking, the fire smouldered. Two swords there fashioned twice he broke them: hard the anvil hewed he mightily – sword was splintered, smith was angered. Sigurd ‘Sigrlinn, say me, was sooth told me of gleaming shards of Grímnir’s sword? Sigmund’s son now seeks them from thee – now Gram shall Regin guileless weld me!’ The forge was flaring, the fire blazing: a blade they brought him with blue edges; they flickered with flame, as it flashed singing – the cloven anvil clashed asunder. The Rhine river ran by swiftly; there tufts of wool on the tide he cast. Sharp it shore them in the sheer water: glad grew Sigurd, Gram there brandished. Sigurd ‘Where lies the heath and hoard golden? Now rede me Regin of roads thither!’ In Busiltarn ran blue the waters, green grew the grass for grazing horse. A man them minded mantled darkly, hoary-bearded, huge and ancient. They drove the horses into deep currents; to the bank they backed from the bitter water. But grey Grani gladly swam there: Sigurd chose him, swift and flawless. Man ‘In the stud of Sleipnir, steed of Ódin, was sired this horse, swiftest, strongest. Ride now! ride now! rocks and mountains, horse and hero, hope of Ódin!’ * Gand rode Regin and Grani Sigurd; the waste lay withered, wide and empty. Fathoms thirty fell the fearful cliff whence the dragon bowed him drinking thirsty. In deep hollow on the dark hillside long there lurked he; the land trembled. Forth came Fáfnir, fire his breathing; down the mountain rushed mists of poison. The fire and fume over fearless head rushed by roaring; rocks were groaning. The black belly, bent and coiling, over hidden hollow hung and glided. Gram was brandished; grimly ringing to the hoary stone heart it sundered. In Fáfnir’s throe were threshed as flails his writhing limbs and reeking head. Black flowed the blood, belching drenched him; in the hollow hiding hard grew Sigurd. Swift now sprang he sword withdrawing: there each saw other with eyes of hate. Fáfnir ‘O man of mankind! What man begot thee? Who forged the flame for Fáfnir’s heart?’ Fáfnir ‘A wolf was thy sire – full well I know it! Who egged thee eager to mine undoing?’ Fáfnir ‘Nay! Regin wrought this, rogue and master! O son of Sigmund! sooth I tell thee: my guarded gold gleams with evil, bale it bringeth to both my foes.’ Sigurd ‘Life each must leave on his latest day, yet gold gladly will grasp living!’ Sigurd ‘A fool, saith Sigurd, could not fend himself with helm of horror – hell now seize him!’ In the heather had hidden as a hare cowering the fear-daunted smith; forth now crept he. Regin ‘Hail! O Völsung victory-crownéd, of mortal men mightiest hero!’ Regin ‘Yet glad is Sigurd, of gold thinking, as Gram on the grey grass he wipeth! ‘Twas blood of my brother that blade did spill, though somewhat the slaying I myself must share.’ Sigurd ‘Far enow thou fleddest, when Fáfnir came. This sword slew him, and Sigurd’s prowess.’ Sigurd ‘Nay, blame not thyself, backward helper! Stout heart is better than strongest sword.’ Thus heavy spake Regin Ridil unsheathing, fell Fáfnir’s heart from the flesh cleaving. Dark blood drank he from the dragon welling; deep drowsing fell on dwarvish smith. Regin ‘Sit now, Sigurd! Sleep o’ercomes me. Thou Fáfnir’s heart at the fire roast me. His dark thought’s dwelling after drink potent I fain would eat, feast of wisdom.’ Sharp spit shaped he; at shining fire the fat of Fáfnir there frothed and hissed. To tongue he touched testing finger – beasts’ cry he knew, and birds’ voices. * first bird ‘A head shorter should hoary liar go hence to nether hell! The heart of Fáfnir I whole would eat if I myself were Sigurd.’ second bird ‘Who a foe lets free is fool indeed, when he was bane of brother! I alone would be lord of linkéd gold, if my wielded sword had won it.’ first bird ‘A head shorter should hiding dwarf deprived of gold perish! There Regin rouses in rustling heather; Vengeance he vows for brother.’ * Round turned Sigurd, and Regin saw he in the heath crawling with hate gleaming. Black spilled the blood as blade clove him, the head hewing of Hreidmar’s son. Dark red the drink and dire the meat whereon Sigurd feasted seeking wisdom. Dark hung the doors and dread the timbers in the earth under of iron builded. Gold piled on gold there glittered palely: that gold was glamoured with grim curses. The Helm of Horror on his head laid he: swart fell the shadow round Sigurd standing. Great and grievous was Grani’s burden, yet lightly leaped he down the long mountain. Ride now! ride now road and woodland, horse and hero, hope of Ódin! * Ever wild and wide the wandering paths; long lay the shadow of lone rider. Birds in the branches blithe were singing: their words he heard, their wit he knew not. Raven ‘High stands a hall on Hindarfell, fire it fenceth flaming-tonguéd; steep stands the path, stern the venture, where mountains beckon to mighty heart.’ Finch ‘A maid have I seen as morning fair, golden-girdled, garland-crownéd. Green run the roads to Gjúki’s land; fate leads them on, who fare that way.’ Raven ‘Slumber bindeth the sun-maiden on mountain high, mail about her. Thorn of Ódin is thrust in bosom – to what shall she wake, woe or laughter?’ Finch ‘The Gjúkings proudly, Gunnar and Högni, there rule a realm by Rhine-water. Gudrún groweth golden-lovely, as flower unfolded fair at morning.’ Raven ‘Too peerless proud her power wielding, victory swaying as Valkyrie, she heard nor heeded hests of Ódin, and Ódin smote whom Ódin loved.’","Gram,Helm",,

A fire at crown, fence of lightning, high to heavenward hissed and wavered. Greyfell Grani, glory seeking, leaped the lightning lightning-sinewed. A wall saw Sigurd of woven shields, a standard streaming striped with silver; a man there war-clad, mailclad, lying, with sword beside him, sleeping deadly. The helm he lifted: hair fell shining, a woman lay there wound in slumber; fast her corslet as on flesh growing – the gleaming links, Gram there clave them. * Brynhild awakening ‘Hail! O Daylight and Day’s children! Hail, Night and Noon and Northern Star! Hail, Kingly Gods, Queens of Ásgard! Hail, Earth’s bosom all-abounding! Hands of healing, hear and grant us, light in darkness, life and wisdom; to both give triumph, truth unfailing, to both in gladness glorious meeting!’ * Brynhild ‘Brynhild greets thee, O brave and fair! What prince hath pierced my pale fetters?’ Brynhild ‘Ódin bound me, Ódin’s chosen; no more to battle, to mate doomed me. An oath I uttered for ever lasting, to wed but one, the World’s chosen.’ Sigurd ‘In the halls of Ódin it were hard to choose man there mightiest, most renownéd.’ Sigurd ‘Seed of Ódin is Sigmund’s child, and Sigurd’s sword is serpent’s bane.’ Sigurd ‘Hail, bright and splendid! Hail, battle-maiden, bride of Völsung Brynhild chosen!’ Troth in triumph twain there plighted alone on mountain; light was round them. Brynhild ‘A beaker I bring thee, O battle-wielder, mighty-blended mead of glory, brimmed with bounty, blessed with healing, and rimmed with runes of running laughter.’ Sigurd ‘I drink, all daring: doom or glory; drink of splendour dear the bearer!’ Sigurd ‘I flee nor flinch, though fey standing, words of wisdom, woe, or gladness.’ Be slow to vengeance, seed of Völsung! In swearing soothfast, the sworn holding. Grim grow the boughs in guile rooted; fair flowers the tree in faith planted! Where the witch-hearted walks or houses linger not, lodge not, though lone the road! Though beauty blindeth bright as morning, let no daughter of kings thy dreams master! Hail, Sigmund’s son! Swift thy glory, yet a cloud meseems creepeth nigh thee. Long life, I fear, lies not before thee, but strife and storm stand there darkly.’ Sigurd ‘Hail, Brynhild wise! Bright thy splendour though fate be strong to find its end. Faith ever will I hold firm, unyielding, though strife and storm stand about me.’ Faith then they vowed fast, unyielding, there each to each in oaths binding. Bliss there was born when Brynhild woke; yet fate is strong to find its end. * Ever wild and wide the wandering paths; on roads shining went riders two. High towered the helm; hair flowed in wind; mail glinted bright on mountain dark. Brynhild ‘Here, Sigmund’s son, swift and fearless, is our way’s parting, to woe or joy. Here, lord, I leave thee, to my land turning; hence Grani bears thee glory seeking.’ Sigurd ‘Why, Brynhild wise, bride of Völsung, when at one are the riders do our ways sunder?’ To her land she turned lonely shining; green ran the roads that Grani strode. To her land she came, long the waiting; in Gjúki’s house glad the singing. * Gudrún ‘O mother, hear me! Mirth is darkened, dreams have troubled me, dreams of boding.’ Gudrún ‘No wind, nor wraith of waking thought – a hart we hunted over hill and valley; all would take him, ’twas I caught him: his hide was golden, his horns towering. A woman wildly on the wind riding with a shaft stung him, shooting pierced him; at my knees he fell in night of woe, my heart too heavy might I hardly bear. A wolf they gave me for woe’s comfort; in my brethren’s blood he bathed me red. Dreams have vexed me, direst boding, not wind or weather or waning moon.’ Grímhild ‘Dreams oft token the dark by light, good by evil, Gudrún daughter! Lift up thine eyes eager shining! Green lie the lands round Gjúki’s house.’ Gudrún ‘The roads run green to the Rhine-water! Who rides here lone, arrayed for war? His helm is high, his horse fleeting, his shield is shining with sheen of gold!’ Thus Gudrún gazed, Gjúki’s daughter, from wall and window in wonder looking. Thus Sigurd rode, seed of Völsung, into Gjúki’s courts gleaming-harnessed. There Gjúki dwelt his gold dealing in Niflung land, the Niflung lord. Gunnar and Högni were Gjúki’s sons, mighty princes; men them hearkened. There Grímhild dwelt, guileful in counsel, grimhearted queen grey with wisdom, with lore of leechcraft, lore of poison, with chill enchantment and with changing spells. As ravens dark were those raven-friends; fair their faces, fierce their glances. With Huns they waged hate and warfare, gold ever gathering in great dungeons. Silent they sat when Sigurd entered Gunnar greeting, Gjúki hailing. Sigurd ‘The son of Sigmund, Sigurd Völsung, a king’s son cometh to kingly house. Fame of Niflungs far is rumoured, not yet hath faded fame of Völsung.’ There swift for Sigurd seat was ordered; the feast grew fair, folk were mirthful. There Gunnar grasped his golden harp; while songs he sang silence fell there. Of these things sang Gunnar By mighty Mirkwood on the marches of the East the great Goth-kings in glory ruled. By Danpar-banks was dread warfare with the hosts of Hunland, horsemen countless. Horsemen countless hastened westward; the Borgund lords met Budli’s host. In Budli’s brother their blades reddened the glad Gjúkings, gold despoiling. Of these things sang Sigurd Then Sigurd seized the sounding harp; hushed they hearkened in the hall listening. The waste lay withered wide and empty; forth came Fáfnir, fire around him. Dark hung the doors on deep timbers; gold piled on gold there glittered wanly. The hoard was plundered, helm was lifted, and Grani greyfell grievous burdened. High Hindarfell, hedged with lightning, mountain mighty from mists uprose. Brynhild wakened, bright her splendour – song fell silent, and Sigurd ended. By Gjúki’s chair Grímhild hearkened, of Gudrún thinking and the golden hoard. Gunnar and Högni gladly bade him in league and love long to dwell there. * The Borgund lords their battle furnished; banners were broidered, blades were sharpened. White shone hauberks, helms were burnished; under horses’ hooves Hunland trembled. Grim was Gunnar on Goti riding; under haughty Högni Hölkvir strode; but fleeter was Grani, foal of Sleipnir; flamed all before the fire of Sigurd. Foes were vanquished, fields were wasted, grimly garnered Gram the harvest. Where Gjúkings rode glory won they, ever glory Sigurd greater conquered. Wide waxed their realm in world of old; Dane-king they slew, doughty princes. Dread fell on folk; doom they wielded; victory rode ever with the Völsung lord. High they honoured him, in heart loved him, Hun-gold gave him in the hall sitting. But his heart remembered house of Völsung, and Sigmund slain on sands afar. A host he gathered, help of Gjúkings; to the sea he rode and sails hoisted. His ship was shining with shields and mail; it was dragon-headed, dire and golden. As fire and tempest to his father’s land came Sigurd sailing; the sand was reddened. Clashed the cloven casque and hauberk; shields were splintered, shorn was corslet. Men learned there lived yet line of Völsung! Now of Völsung land was a Völsung lord. But the house once high was hollow, roofless; the limbs were rotten of their leafy tree. A man there walked mantled darkly, his beard was flowing, and blind his eye: Where Sigmund drew sword of Grímnir, Gram shall shine not. Go thou, Völsung! Now king thou art of kings begotten, a bride calls thee over billowing seas.’ * His fleet went forth with flaming sails; goldladen ships came glad to shore. Steeds went striding, stonefire glinted, horns were sounded; home rode Sigurd. A feast they fashioned, far proclaimed it, their highroofed halls hung with splendour; boards and beakers, benches, gilded; mead poured and ale from morn to eve. A king sat Sigurd: carven silver, raiment gleaming, rings and goblets, dear things dealt he, doughty-handed, his friends enriching, fame upraising. (There spake Grímhild to Gjúki’s ear:) Grímhild ‘How long shall last league unbounden? Here is worthiest lord of world’s renown! Were a daughter offered, he would dwell for ever, our strength in strife, standing bulwark.’ Gjúki ‘The gifts of kings are gold and silver; their daughters fair are dearly wooed!’ Sigurd sat silent; the singing heard not but in heart Brynhild bright with splendour: ‘A queen was I once, and a king shall wed.’ Soon, thought he, soon I will seek my own. * Grímhild went forth to guarded bower; deep horn she filled that was darkly written. She drink of power dreadly blended; it had strength of stone, it was stained with blood. Grímhild ‘Hail, guest and king! Good go with thee! Drink now deeply dear love’s token! A father hast thou found, and fond mother, brothers sit nigh thee. O bravest, hail!’ Deep drank Sigurd, drained it laughing, then sat unsmiling, the singing heard not. In came Gudrún gleaming-robéd, as flower unfolded fair at morning. Sigurd wondered, silent gazing; his mind was glamoured, mood confounded. * Brynhild abode a blossomed summer, homing harvest, hoary winter. A year followed year; yearning seized her: the king came not; cold weighed her heart. Of her wealth and splendour wide spread the word; kings came riding, her courts thronging. Her mood was troubled, her mind darkened; fell greeting found they, and few returned. One armed and mantled as ancient king wild steed there rode than wind fleeter. Spear upholding spiked with lightning her hall he entered, hailed her darkly: King ‘Bond unbroken shall be bounden oath, dreed and endured be doom appointed. Brynhild full soon shall bridal drink; choosing not the slain, shall choose the living. Brynhild must drink the bridal feast, ere winters two o’er the world be passed. A queen thou wert, a king shalt wed: Ódin dooms it; Ódin hearken!’ Fire forth blossomed, flames were kindled, high up-leaping hissed and wavered. In hall standing hedged with lightning, ‘one only’, thought she ‘can enter now!’ * In Gjúki’s house glad the singing. A feast they fashioned, far men sought it. To blissful Gudrún the bridal drank there golden Sigurd glorious shining. Morning woke with mirth, merry came evening; harp-strings were plucked by hands of cunning; mead poured and ale, men were joyful, of peerless kings praise uplifting. Oaths swore Sigurd for ever lasting, a bond of brotherhood in blood mingled, help in venture, in hate and battle, in need and desire, nowhere failing. Gunnar and Högni gladly swore it, as Grímhild counselled grey with wisdom. Gunnar and Högni good they deemed it; glad was Gudrún gleaming-lovely. Gudrún walked in joy, gladness round her; mornings came with mirth, mirth at sleeping. Sigurd dwelt as king sweet days and nights; high hope he had, yet in heart a shadow. * Wide went the word of woman mighty, of Brynhild queen bright in splendour. Grímhild hearkened, grimly pondered, of Gunnar thinking and of Gjúki’s power. Grímhild ‘Hail, Gjúki’s son! Good go with thee! Fair flowers thy state, thy fame riseth. Who could woo as he wills, a wife yet lacketh, though his might few match, or might of friends.’ Gunnar ‘Lo! Gjúkings’ mother grey in counsel, what wife shall Gunnar woo or look for? Fairest must be woman, of fame mightiest, that Gunnar seeketh his gold dealing.’ Grímhild ‘Of the one fairest fame is rumoured: Brynhild the queen bright in splendour. Wide walks the word of her wealth and might; though high nor humble her halls enter.’ Gunnar ‘Proud and peerless in peril woven, a queen would she be, our courts’ glory! Gunnar Gjúki’s son glory seeking at thy rede shall ride to her realm afar.’ Grímhild ‘The son of Sigmund thy sister holds, Sigurd the mighty is thy sworn brother. At right hand in aid he shall ride with thee; counsels potent shall my cunning find you.’ * Gunnar rode Goti, on Grani Sigurd, Högni Hölkvir, horse night-swarthy. Steeds were striding, stonefire glinting, high wind rushing over helm and mane. Over fell and lowland and forest gloomy, over rocks and rivers their roads led them. Golden gables gleaming saw they; a light was lifted o’er the land afar. Fire forth blossomed, flames up-leaping, trees of lightning twisted branching. Gunnar smote Goti: the ground spurning he reared him backward, nor rowel heeded. Sigurd unsmiling silent waited, in his shrouded heart a shadow deepened: Gunnar ‘A boon grant me, O blood-brother! Goti will not bear me, now Grani lend me!’ Gunnar smote Grani: on the ground moveless grey-hewn he stood as of graven stone. Gunnar rode not the glittering flame. Oaths swore Sigurd, all fulfilled them. In hope or hate help unfailing, he Grímhild’s counsel grim refused not. Counsels potent had her cunning furnished of chill enchantment and changing spell. In Gunnar’s likeness on Grani leaped he; gold spurs glinted, Gram was brandished. The earth shivered; angry roaring fire flaming-tongued flashed heavenward. With sword smitten snorting leaped he, Grani greyfell; the ground trembled. The fire flickered; flame wavered, sank to silence slaked and fading. Swart lay the shadow of Sigurd riding in helm of terror high and looming. Sigurd stood there on sword leaning; Brynhild waited a blade holding. There helméd maiden of helméd king name demanded: night fell round them. Sigurd ‘Gunnar Gjúki’s son greets and hails thee. As my queen shalt thou ride my quest fulfilling.’ As on swaying seas a swan glimmering sat she sore troubled seeking counsel: Brynhild ‘What shall I answer in hour o’ershadowed, Gunnar, Gunnar, with gleaming eyes?’ Brynhild ‘Gunnar, speak not of golden rings! Swords were me dearer to slay my loves. Art thou all men’s master, all surpassing? – to only such will I answer give.’ Sigurd ‘Yea, swords hast thou reddened, swords yet shalt wield; and oaths hast thou sworn, and oaths shalt keep. Thy wall is ridden, thy wavering fire: thou art doomed him to wed who dared to pass.’ In a bed them laid Brynhild, Sigurd; a sword them sundered set there naked. Gram lay between gleaming sheathless, fate lay between forged unyielding. Dawn came on earth, day grew round them. From sleeping finger he slipped her ring, and Andvari’s gold, old, enchanted, on Brynhild’s hand bound in token. Sigurd ‘Wake thou! wake thou! Wide is daylight. I ride to my realm to array the feast.’ * On day appointed dawn rose redly, sun sprang fiery southward hasting. Bridal to Brynhild blissful drank he, Gunnar Gjúki’s son, gold unsparing. All surpassing, proud and ardent, Brynhild sat there, a bride and queen. All men’s master, all surpassing, in came Sigurd as sun rising. By Gudrún’s side, Gjúki’s daughter, she saw him seated – a silence fell. As stone graven stared she palely, as cold and still as carven stone. From shrouded heart the shadows parted; oaths were remembered all unfulfilled. As stone carven, stern, unbending, he sat unsmiling no sign making. Clamour rose again, clear the singing. Men were joyful – mirth they deemed it. In that hall beheld they heroes mightiest, and kings and queens crowned in splendour. * Forth rode Sigurd, the forest seeking, to hunt the hart; horns were sounded. To the Rhine-river, to running water, queens went comely with combs of gold. Their locks they loosened. Long one waded to deeper pools darkly swirling: Gudrún ‘More queenly I, more kingly wed! – fame all surpasses he that Fáfnir slew!’ (Grim laughed Gudrún Grímhild’s daughter:) Andvari’s ring, old, enchanted, is on Brynhild’s hand bound in token. Did Gunnar give me the gleaming ring from thy hand he drew, now here on mine!’ Coldhued as death the queen was stricken, strode swift from stream as stone silent; from Rhine-river, from running water, her bower sought she brooding darkly. Dim fell evening, dusk was starless; her mind was as night as she mourned alone; alone, lightless, made lamentation: Mine own must I have or anguish suffer, or suffer anguish Sigurd losing. Yet he is Gudrún’s and Gunnar’s I: foul wrought the fates that framed my life!’ Daylong lay she drinking nor eating, as in dead slumber or dreadful thought. Her maidens marvelled – she minded not, Gunnar sought her; grim she heard him. Then spake Brynhild from bitter pondering: Brynhild ‘King men call thee! A coward rather, from fire flinching, fearful, quaking! From witch-woman’s womb thou camest. Woe to Grímhild, woe’s contriver!’ Gunnar ‘Vile words to use, thou Valkyrie, thou slayer of men, and sword-hearted!’ Him only loved I who all surpassed; an oath uttered, him only to wed, him only to wed who mine ardent fire vanquished valorous; I am vow-breaker. I am oath-breaker, dishonoured, humbled; I am love-bereaved and life-curséd. In thy halls shalt thou hear never happy voices, no queen in thy courts shall comely walk.’ Long there lay she in lamentation; afar heard folk her fell mourning. Gudrún she spurned, Gunnar scorning, and Högni mocking; hate was kindled. * From the hunt rode Sigurd home returning, found halls unlit and hearts darkened. They brought him to seek her for sorrow’s healing; his mood was loath, on the morrow went he. (He draws back the coverlet from Brynhild and wakes her, as before he had done.) Sigurd ‘Hail, O sunlight and sun’s rising! Sleep no longer and sorrow cast thou!’ Sigurd ‘What grief ails thee amid good liking, who to glorious Gunnar wert gladly wed?’ Sigurd ‘Yet glory no less hath Gjúki’s son, my blood-brother, best renownéd. Well he loves thee, lord unfearing – look now and learn light yet shineth!’ Brynhild ‘Nay, Fáfnir Sigurd fearless conquered; my wavering fire he waded twice; twice he waded tongues of lightning: so great glory never Gunnar earned.’ Sigurd ‘That twice he waded, who told thee so? Sigurd hath not said it – why saist thou this?’ Veils of darkness they vanquished me. I am life-curséd and love-bereaved. Yet I curse thee too, cruel forswearer, who rendered to another the ring taken. Gudrún I curse for cruel reproach of bed broken and body yielded. Thy glory alone seems good to thee; of all women the worst thou weenest me.’ Sigurd ‘Woe worth the words by women spoken! Woe worth the while this work began! Webs enwound me woven dreadly, my mind shadowing, my mood darkening. Long I loved thee, long desiring. Thee only would I hold, now all I know. My mood mastering, my mind wielding, I sat unsmiling, no sign making. This solace sought I, that I saw thee still, the one hall walking though wife of other.’ Sigurd ‘Is hope all fallen, is healing vain? Must fate fierce-hearted thus find its end?’ Sigurd ‘Swords lightly sleep, soon may I feel them! Then would Brynhild die – bitter would she deem it.’ Sigurd ‘Yet Gunnar would I slay, Gudrún forsake, from death thee to keep, our doom o’ercoming!’ * Forth went Sigurd filled with anguish, his heart was swollen in heaving breast. Mail-rings clutched him, marred his breathing, to his flesh cutting fiercely straining. There stood Gudrún gleaming-lovely: Gudrún wanly grasped him weeping: (Then spake Gunnar gloomy-hearted:) Then Gunnar offered gold and silver, gold and silver gleaming-hoarded. All men’s master, all surpassing, such only ever shall earn my love. Than thy liege lower thou art less become, a Völsung’s squire, a vassal’s servant! From thy bed parting, at thy board humbled I will leave thee alone to laughter of men, if life thou allowest to liege forsworn, if thou slay not Sigurd, thy sister’s lord.’ Gunnar ‘Fell-hearted thou, and foe of peace! I oaths have sworn for ever lasting, bonds of brotherhood in blood mingled; though Brynhild bid it, I may break them not.’ Brynhild ‘Oaths too I swore for ever lasting – light thou heldest them! I am love-betrayed. Sigurd thou sent me, thy sworn brother. My bed he entered, by my body laid him, betrayed thy trust, betraying me. To Gudrún he told it, Gudrún knoweth. In shame am I shrouded, and shamed art thou!’ Gunnar came forth grievous-hearted, daylong he sat, deeply brooding. From mood to mood his mind wandered, from shame to shame shorn of friendship. Högni called he to hidden counsel, his true brother, whom he trusted well. Gunnar ‘Evil wrought Sigurd: oaths he swore me, oaths he swore me, all belied them; betrayed my trust, whom I trusted most, truth forswearing, whom most true I deemed.’ Högni ‘Brynhild beguiles thee baleful-hearted, woe devising to woe stings thee; loathing Gudrún, her love grudging, thy love loathing, she lies to thee.’ Gunnar ‘Brynhild, Brynhild, I better hold her than all women, than all treasure. I will life sooner leave than lose her now, than live lonely for laughter of men. Let us slay Sigurd – forsworn is he! Let us lords be alone of our lands again! Let us slay Sigurd, this sorrow ending, and masters make us of his mighty hoard!’ Högni ‘Woe worth the words by women spoken! Lords unassailed our league made us. The might of Sigurd we shall mourn later, and the sister-sons this sire had got us.’ To Gotthorm turning, Grímhild’s offspring, greyhearted lord, Gunnar hailed him: Gold he promised him and great lordship; his bastard blood burned with hunger. Snake’s flesh they took, seethed it darkly, wolf-meat gave him, wine enchanted. Drunk with madness, dire and wolvish, he grinned and gnashed his grinding teeth. Of guile unworthy, no guile dreaming, yet doom foreboding, drear went Sigurd. To the forest fared he, falcon loosing, with hounds hunting, for harm’s solace. Gotthorm rode there, and Grani marked he, assailing Sigurd, with searing words. Gotthorm ‘O werewolf’s son and war-captive, what huntest here where hart roameth – thou wooer of women and wife-marrer, who wouldst lord all alone our lands and queens!’ Sword touched Sigurd swart-red flushing; white blanched the knuckles on hilt clenching: Gotthorm he left to grind his teeth; back rode Sigurd foreboding ill. Night fell starless, none were waking; asleep was Gudrún by Sigurd dreaming. Dawn came wanly: drunk with hatred there Gotthorm stalked as glowering wolf. Sword leaped naked, sleeping stabbed him, pierced through to pillow, pinned in anguish. Forth sprang the wolf by fear blinded of awful eyes that opened wide. Gram was brandished, gleaming handled, hissing hurled aloft at hasting beast. At the door he tumbled dreadly crying; there hell took him hewn asunder. Forth crashed the head, feet fell backward; blood ran darkly on bower threshold. In sweet embrace to sleep she went, to grief unending Gudrún wakened, to her bliss drowning in blood flowing. in flowing blood of fairest lord. Breast white and bare she beat so sore that Sigurd raised him from soaking pillow: Brynhild wrought this: best she loved me, worst she dealt me, worst belied me. I Gunnar never grieved nor injured; oaths I swore him, all fulfilled them!’ Dead fell Sigurd; dreadly Gudrún cried in anguish, called him vainly. Swords rang on wall, and sleepers shivered; geese screamed shrill in green meadow. Then laughed Brynhild in her bed listening with whole heart once – the house shuddered – Gudrún hearing in grief’s torment. Gunnar answered grimly speaking: Gunnar ‘Little thou laughest for delight of soul, O fell-hearted! Fey I deem thee. Thy colour blancheth, cold thy cheeks are; cold thy counsels and accursed thy redes.’ Brynhild ‘Cursed are the Niflungs, cruel forswearers. Oaths swore Sigurd, all fulfilled them. Ye all shall find evil fortune, while all men’s honour he for ever holdeth. Bonds of brotherhood in blood mingled with murder kept ye; he remembered them. A sword lay naked set between us, Gram lay grimly gleaming sheathless. Now life no longer will I live with you; of love ye robbed me with lying counsels. Shorn I leave you, shame enduring, of faith and friendship, of fame on earth.’ In arms he took her, anguished begged her her hand to stay, hope to look for. She thrust them from her who thronged round her, longing only for her last journey. (Högni only withheld her not:) * Gold corslet she took, gleaming hauberk, helm set on head, in hand a sword. On the sword she cast her, sank down wounded: thus Brynhild ended her bright splendour. Brynhild ‘A boon I beg thee, this boon at last! Pile high a pyre on the plain builded; shields hang round it and shining cloths, blood pour over it for us brightly shed! A hawk at each hand, a hound at feet, there harnessed set ye our horses slain. At his side lay me, sword between us, naked gleaming as on night of yore. Burn there Brynhild in the blazing fire who in flames awoke to fell sorrow. In flames send forth that fairest lord now as sun setting who as sun did rise!’ Flames were kindled, fume was swirling, a roaring fire ringed with weeping. Thus Sigurd passed, seed of Völsung, there Brynhild burned: bliss was ended. * On the hell-way hastened the helméd queen, never born again from bleak regions. In Valhöllu Völsungs feasted: ‘Son’s son welcome, seed of Ódin!’ Thus soon came Sigurd the sword bearing to glad Valhöll greeting Ódin. There feasts he long at his father’s side, for War waiting, the World’s chosen. When Heimdall’s horn is heard ringing and the Blazing Bridge bends neath horsemen, Brynhild shall arm him with belt and sword, a beaker bear him brimmed with glory. In the day of Doom he shall deathless stand who death tasted and dies no more, the serpent-slayer, seed of Ódin: not all shall end, nor Earth perish. On his head the Helm, in his hand lightning, afire his spirit, in his face splendour. When war passeth in world rebuilt, bliss shall they drink who the bitter tasted. Thus passed Sigurd, seed of Völsung, hero mightiest, hope of Ódin. But woe of Gudrún through this world lasteth, to the end of days all shall hear her. *","Gram,Helm,Grim",Mirkwood,

Does it serve an artistic purpose – or is it just accidental, due to some confusion in the saga-writer’s source, or in the handing down of the saga? It is probably intentional, and perhaps not bad. The saga-writer has constructed a picture of Regin, already plotting Sigurd’s removal, and trying as it were to justify himself to himself.

Tolkien,IX DEILD (Strife),IX,,TEXT_EXTRA,"12–20 Brynhild’s withdrawal to her bedchamber in black silence, lying like one dead, and her words with Gunnar when he came to her, derive in a general way from the Saga; but the long reproach that in the Saga she casts at him differs greatly from the equivalent passage in the Lay (stanzas 15–19). In the Saga she began, when at last prevailed upon by Gunnar to speak, by asking him: ‘What have you done with the ring I gave you, which king Budli gave me at our last parting, when you Gjúkings came to him and vowed to harry and burn unless you gained me?’ Then she said that Budli had given her two choices, to wed as he wished, or to lose all her wealth and his favour; and seeing that she could not strive with him she promised to wed the one who would ride through her fire on the horse Grani with Fáfnir’s hoard. This further confusion arising from the ‘doubled’ view of Brynhild is once again eliminated in the Lay, as are other details of the story in the Saga: the fettering of Brynhild by Högni after her threat to kill Gunnar, and her tearing of her tapestry apart.",,,

Life she hated, but life took not, witless wandering in woods alone. * Atli ariseth armies wielding; on the marches of the East his might waxeth. Goths he tramples, gold despoiling, his horsemen countless hasten westward. He, Budli’s son, blades remembers that of Budli’s brother were the bane of old; he, gold-greedy, grimhearted king, hath heard of the hoard on the Heath that lay. Of Fáfnir’s treasure fame was rumoured, that Niflungs held in Niflung-land; of Gudrún’s beauty gleaming-lovely; of Gjúki aged to his grave passing. * From mighty Mirkwood came message darkly: ‘Atli ariseth armies mustering. Hate awakens, hosts are arming; under horses’ hooves Hunland trembles!’ Gunnar spake then gloomy-hearted: Then spake Högni, haughty chieftain: Then spake Grímhild grey with wisdom: Gudrún they sought, grieving found her in woodland house weaving lonely; weaving wondrous webs bright-figured with woe tangled and with works of old. * Ódin she wrought old, blue-mantled; Loki lightfooted with locks of flame; the falls of Andvari framed of silver, the gold of Andvari she gleaming wove. The house of Völsung huge was timbered, the Tree there tossed tangled branches. There Grímnir’s gift gleaming brandished Sigmund standing stern unbending. The hall of Siggeir high was burning fire-encircled flame-devouréd. Signý stood there Sigmund greeting, fire about her, flame behind her. Shields of silver had the ship of Sigmund; wild the waves were, wind them twisted. Sailed there slowly Sinfjötli’s bier through stormy seas steered by Ódin. There Regin wrought by the red embers; there Gram was hammered amid gleaming sparks. High loomed the head of helméd dragon; under black belly there was blink of gold. Long lay the shadow of lone rider golden-harnessed Gram brandishing; sun-bright Sigurd seed of Völsung, on Grani riding into Gjúki’s courts. * Golden weregild Gunnar brought her, haughty Högni humbly bent him. Gudrún they hailed, Gunnar and Högni; head she turned not, hate still burned her. In came Grímhild guileful-hearted: Gudrún lifted her grieving eyes, dimmed with weeping, dark with mourning. Dark with wisdom, deep with purpose were Grímhild’s eyes gazing through her. Grímhild ‘Atli ariseth, armies wieldeth, king of Eastland’s countless peoples. His queen shall rule courts of splendour, over all women else on earth upraised.’ Gudrún ‘Of gold were the days, gold and silver, silver and golden, ere Sigurd came. A maid among maids in mirth walked I; only dreams and shadows, only dreams vexed me. A hart I dreamed high and golden: now is sped the shaft and spilled the blood. A wolf thou gavest me for woe’s comfort, in my brethren’s blood he bathed me red. I love them little, I believe them not, but my brethren’s blood is no boot for me. How shall husband heal me of harm I bear in hateful Hunland who am hopeless now?’ Grímhild ‘Thy brothers blame not! Brynhild wrought it, thy wrong and sorrow – it rues them sore. And dreams are but dreams, or else doom foretell; yet doom must be dreed, though dreams foreshow. Hungold is bright, Hunland is wide, Atli mightiest of earthly kings. And gold is healing, though grieve the heart; a queen’s bed better than one cold and bare!’ Gudrún ‘Why drivest me on with daunting eyes dire of purpose, doom forestalling? To Sigurd thou gavest me, to sorrow it turned; now leave me to rest, leave thy daughter!’ Grímhild ‘No rest for the living, no room for tears, who with pride and purpose oppose their fate! No rest I grant thee! My redes hearken, or rue for ever thou wert wrought on earth!’ Dark hung her eyes daunting Gudrún, deep and dreadful, dire with purpose. For no word she waited, wisdom knew she; forth went Grímhild from Gudrún’s side. * Of Gudrún’s beauty glad was Atli; of gold he dreamed him guarded darkly; of the serpent’s hoard that Sigurd left her, of the wife of Sigurd of women fairest. Bridal drank he blissful-hearted to Gudrún pale in gleaming robes. Oaths he swore them, to each her brothers, and lasting truce, league of kinship. Dark and splendid, dreadly builded, and echoing vast were Atli’s halls. Kings sat neath him, countless chieftains, and Hunnish horsemen harnessed grimly. High sat Gudrún Hunland’s mistress, cold lay Gudrún queen of Hunland. Her lord loved her, lovely was she; laughter she knew not, yet her limbs were white. But longer him lasted his lust of gold, the gold he dreamed him guarded darkly. The serpent’s treasure they sent it never, the Niflungs kept it in Niflung-land. Long he pondered, till lust swayed him; woes were wakened and wars of old. Long nights lying he looked on her; dark nights drowsing he dreamed of gold. Oaths he had uttered, evil he pondered; but his heart’s purpose was hidden under. Yet words he muttered in wandering sleep; Gudrún guessed them, gloom foreboding. A feast he fashioned, far proclaimed it; to high-builded halls his hosts were bidden; all kith and kindred called to greet him, to dealing of rings, drink and laughter. * On valiant horse Vingi swiftly, herald of Hunland, hasted westward. To Gunnar came he, Gjúking mighty, to halls of Rhineland high and golden. There drank they deep; dark they eyed him, Hun-speech hearing in their hall ringing. Cold fell his cry calling loudly under helm standing hailing Gunnar. Vingi ‘Atli hath sent me on errand speedy, on horse hasting through hoar forest. Gunnar he greeteth, Gunnar and Högni. Be blithe he bids you, to his boon hearken! A feast he fashions, fair he dights it, all kith and kindred calls to meet him. Rings will he deal, raiment costly, saddles silverlaid, and southern purple. Shields shall ye choose there and shirts of mail, spears smooth-shafted and splendid helms. Gifts will he give you, graven silver, gold-hilted swords, and goodly lands.’ His head bowed Gunnar to Högni speaking: Is there sword in the East that my sword matcheth? Are there helms in Hunland so high as ours? Are we lieges of Atli, lands receiving from Hun master? Högni answer!’ Högni ‘Of Gudrún I think – grim thoughts awake! A ring she hath sent me, a ring only. Wolf’s hair winds it, woven round it, wolves lie in wait at the way’s ending.’ Gunnar ‘Yet runes she sends me, runes of healing, words well-graven on wood to read; fast bids us fare to feast gladly, old woes forgetting and ancient wrong.’ * Gifts gave Gunnar, guerdon kingly; wine bade men bring to weary guest. Deep there drank they to day’s ending, doom they recked not; din resounded. In came Grímhild grey with wisdom, the runes she read, the written tokens. Her brows darkened boding evil; to Gunnar spake she grave and slowly. Grímhild ‘These runes I doubt: they are writ with cunning, strangely twisted, stained and darkened. There were others under, now overlaid – if I read them right they were runes of ill.’ Gunnar had drunken, to his guest turned he: Laughing said Vingi: I must haste away, so will hide it not, that Atli is old, but Erp is young. Thy sister’s son is but seven winters – strong hands he needs to steer his realm. In Gunnar hoped he for guide and help, of his sister’s son the safe keeper. He weened ye might wield his wide kingdom – ye are fallen afraid, and fear shadows.’ Högni him answered hard and scornful: Yet Atli I heard not too old for guile, war to ponder, or wealth to covet. And fey saith my thought: “Far lies the day ere Erp or Eitill after Atli rule!”’ But loud cried Gunnar laughing scornful, deep had he drunken darkly musing: Winds shall wander where wine we drank, but Gunnar will go Gudrún seeking. We fast shall follow thy feet, Vingi! Our horns shall be heard Hunland rousing.’ (From heavy heart then Högni answered:) Then vowed Vingi the venom-tonguéd – oaths he recked not, the oft forsworn: * Niflungs rode forth from Niflung-land; fast their journey, few went with them. Grímhild stood there grey and aged, dark eyes were dimmed death foreseeing. Their word was spoken, wills were hardened; fate drove them on, fey they parted. None might hinder near them thronging, lords nor wisemen; with a laugh they rode. Steeds went striding, stonefire glinted, rocks were ringing, roads resounding. In hoar forests harts were startled, over hill and valley hooves were beating. Over river rowed they roaring onward; oars were bending urged to breaking. Foam flew from prow, flashed and sparkled; at bank unbound the boats left they. In the hoar forest horns they sounded Hunland rousing; hooves were beating. Golden harness gleamed and sparkled; steeds came striding stung to madness. * From hill upon high halls they looked on, walls and watchtowers wondrous-builded. They were forest-girdled, fenced with spearmen; horses neighed there, helms were glinting. There was clamour in the courts, cold rang the steel; shafts were shaken, shields them answered. Gates found they barred, grim doors of iron: Högni smote them, hewed them fiercely. (Forth came Vingi the venom-tonguéd:) Högni ‘Heralds were holy – but unhallowed liar, thou shalt hang the first, and hell take thee!’ From the oak-branches with arms corded they hung him high in the Huns’ faces. Huns loud clamoured, hate was kindled; forth rushed they fell, fierce the onslaught. In battle blended Budlungs, Niflungs; blades were brandished, burst were helmets. Back they beat them broken-harnessed; to the doors they drove them – din was in the gates. In leaped Högni, held the gateway, hewed two-handed, hurled them backward. The few and fearless as a fire entered, as roaring flame, wrath devouring. Wolves sprang behind, the ways were reddened, the walls echoed, wailing filled them. Steep, stone-builded, the stair arose to dark doorways dreadly timbered. There Högni halted, hailed them loudly: Out came Atli, anger-clouded: That gold give me that is Gudrún’s right, that Sigurd conquered, the serpent’s treasure!’ Högni laughed then, on his hilts leaning; Gunnar glowering grimly answered. Gunnar ‘No gold from Gunnar shalt thou get for ever! Life canst thou take at latest end. Dear wilt thou buy it in dread barter of lords and lieges, lives uncounted!’ Atli ‘Fools the Niflungs, feud-forgetful; foul-stained their hands with friend-murder. Gudrún’s husband for Gudrún’s wrong a grim vengeance will gladly wreak.’ Gunnar ‘Here Gudrún spake not! Golden weregild she looks nor longs for – the lust is thine!’ Horns they sounded – hall-walls echoed – strode the stairway; stern their onslaught. The stones they stained with streaming blood; snaketonguéd arrows sang about them. Doors clanged backward, din resounded: Hunland’s champions hurled upon them. Hard were handstrokes, hewn were corslets, as on hundred anvils were hammers ringing. * In hall sat Gudrún at heart weary, from mood to mood her mind wavered. The din she hearkened, deadly crying, as back were beaten the Borgund-lords. Gudrún ‘Little I love them, long I hated! A wolf they gave me for woe’s comfort. Yet the wolf rends them, and woe is me! Woe worth the hour that of womb I came!’ Her hands she wrung on high standing, loud called she clear to lieges there: Who would love requite, who would lies disown, who remember misery by these masters wrought, arm now! arm now! aid the fearless betrayed and trapped by this troll-people!’ Atli sat there, anger burned him; yet murmurs mounted, men were rising. Goths were there many: griefs they remembered, wars in Mirkwood and wars of old. From the hall striding high they shouted, foes turned to friends fiercely greeted: ‘Goths and Niflungs our gods helping will hew the Huns to hell’s shadow!’ The few and fearless fiercely answered (their backs were driven to the builded walls): Of the Goths’ glory Gunnar sang there; of Iormunrek earth-shadowing king; of Angantýr and old battles, of Dylgja, Dúnheið, and Danpar’s walls. Forth went Högni, hate rekindled, his son Snævar at his side leaping. Hewn was Högni by a Hun chieftain; his shield was shorn in shards falling. Snævar they slew there, their swords stabbed him; he left his life laughing grimly. Högni wept not; from his hand the shield stooping lifted; strode then onward. The stairs they strode streaming redly; at dark doorways they dinned and hammered; into halls of Atli hewed a pathway; rushed in roaring, reeking-handed. Gudrún they greeted, Gunnar and Högni: Gudrún ‘If for wrongs ye wrought ruth now moves you, doom forestall not! This deed forego!’ Forth went Atli, anguish gnawed him; to Gudrún Högni said grim farewell: * Forth sent Atli his errand-riders; Hunland hearkened, hosts were arming. Gallowsfowl to gladden Goths and Niflungs from the hall they hurled the Hunnish corpses. Daylight grew dim, dark shadows walked in echoing halls that Atli loved. In need most dire the Niflung lords doom awaited; the doors were shut. Night lapped the world and noiseless town; under ashen moonlight the owls hooted. At guarded doorways Gunnar and Högni silent sat they sleepless waiting. First spake Högni: Gunnar answered: There is tramp of men torches bearing, clink of corslet, clank of armour. There is crying of ravens, cold howls the wolf, shields are shimmering, shafts uplifted.’ Gunnar & Högni ‘Wake now, wake now! War is kindled. Now helm to head, to hand the sword. Wake now, warriors, wielding glory! To wide Valhöll ways lie open.’ * At the dark doorways they dinned and hammered; there was clang of swords and crash of axes. The smiths of battle smote the anvils; sparked and splintered spears and helmets. In they hacked them, out they hurled them, bears assailing, boars defending. Stones and stairways streamed and darkened; day came dimly – the doors were held. Five days they fought few and dauntless; the doors were riven, dashed asunder. They barred them with bodies, bulwarks piling of Huns and Niflungs hewn and cloven. (Atli spoke then anguish mourning:) Woe and wailing in my wide kingdom! Where I feasted long are fell serpents. The proud pillars are purple-stained in the builded halls that Budli reared.’ Then Beiti spake there bale devising, the king’s counsellor – he was cunning-hearted: Fire still may tame these fell serpents, thy pillars be the pyre of these proud robbers!’ For the ruin and wrack wrath seized Atli; that shame he shirked not, shorn of glory. Flame-encircled fearless Niflungs in riven harness redly glinted. Iron-bolted walls, ancient timbers, creaked and smouldered, cracked and tumbled. There hot and smoking fell hissing embers, and plashed and sputtered in the pools of gore. Reek was round them, a rolling smoke; dank dripped their sweat – the doors were held. Their shields they raised over shattered helmets; they stamped the brands on streaming floors. Blacktongued with thirst blood there drank they; fell one by one on the ways to hell. Out burst the brethren blackhued, grisly, boars bleeding-tusked at bay at last. The Huns grasped them helmless, shieldless, bare and bleeding, with broken swords. As hounds affrighted Huns were crying; they were rent and riven by reeking hands. Necks were broken and knees sundered, ere the Borgund king was bound and thrown. Last fought Högni alone hopeless; his teeth tore them as they tied him down. The dust was bitten, the doom fallen, the Need of the Niflungs and their night was come. In dank prison dark and evil Högni hurled they; Huns him guarded. But Gunnar bound in Gudrún’s bower was flung at the feet of her frenzied lord. Atli ‘Too long have I looked for this last meeting, Budlung’s vengeance on Borgund lord. Here lies at last in lowly dust lordly Gunnar! Gudrún behold! Sigurd remember, and say me now, is it sweet to see him so sore avenged? In my serpent-pit snakes are waiting – they bite more bitter than blades of steel!’ Gunnar he trampled, Gudrún saw him: Atli ‘Let them give me the gold, the gleaming hoard, the serpent’s treasure that Sigurd conquered! The gold, the gold that grieves my dreams – if Gunnar will grant it, I will grant him thee!’ Gunnar ‘I will give thee the gold, goodly portion, the half yielding which I hold my own. Half hath Högni, my haughty brother; to his latest breath he will loose it not. Let heart of Högni at my hand be laid from breast bleeding with blades severed; then gold will I give, gold of serpents – all shall Atli eager take it!’ Gudrún ‘Yet Högni no less, mine hapless brother, I did beg from thee by those born of us!’ Out went Atli, evil he purposed; but wisemen bade him wary counsel. The queen fearing of cunning thought they; a thrall they seized and thrust in prison. * Hjalli the thrall ‘Woe worth the wiles and wars of kings, if my life I must lose in their luckless feud! The light of morning, labour daylong, fire at evening, too few my days!’ Huns ‘Hjalli, swineherd, thy heart give us!’ Shrilly shrieked he at the shining knife. They bared his breast, and bitter wailed he; ere the point pricked him he piercing cried. Högni heard him, to the Huns spake he: The heart then cut they from Hjalli’s bosom; to Gunnar bore it on golden dish: Gunnar ‘I hapless see here heart of craven. Högni hath not heart that trembles. Quivering lies it; quaked it swifter beating in baseborn breast ignoble.’ Loudly laughed he at life’s ending, when knife was come to Niflung lord. The heart they cut from Högni’s bosom; to Gunnar bore it on golden dish. Gunnar ‘I haughty see here heart undaunted. Högni held it, heart untrembling. Unshaken lies it, so shook it seldom beating in boldest breast of princes. Alone now living, Lord of Niflungs, the gold I hold and guard for ever! In hall nor heath nor hidden dungeon shall friend or foeman find it gleaming. Rhine shall rule it, rings and goblets, in weltering water wanly shining. In the deeps we cast it; dark it rolleth, as useless to man as of yore it proved! Cursed be Atli, king of evil, of glory naked, gold-bereavéd; gold-bereavéd, gold-tormented, murder-tainted, murder-haunted!’ Fires of madness flamed and started from eyes of Atli; anguish gnawed him: * There gleaming-eyed Gudrún waited; the heart within her hardened darkly. Grim mood took her, Grímhild’s daughter, ruthless hatred, wrath consuming. There grimly waited Gunnar naked; snakes were creeping silent round him. Teeth were poisoned, tongues were darting; in lidless eyes light was shining. A harp she sent him; his hands seized it, strong he smote it; strings were ringing. Wondering heard men words of triumph, song up-soaring from the serpents’ pit. There coldly creeping coiling serpents as stones were staring stilled, enchanted. There slowly swayed they, slumber whelmed them, as Gunnar sang of Gunnar’s pride. As voice in Valhöll valiant ringing the golden Gods he glorious named; of Ódin sang he, Ódin’s chosen, of Earth’s most mighty, of ancient kings. A huge adder hideous gleaming from stony hiding was stealing slow. Huns still heard him his harp thrilling, and doom of Hunland dreadly chanting. An ancient adder evil-swollen, to breast it bent and bitter stung him. Loud cried Gunnar life forsaking; harp fell silent, and heart was still. To the queen that cry came clear and piercing; aghast she sat in guarded bower. Erp and Eitill eager called she: dark their locks were, dark their glances. * Pyres they builded proud and stately; Hunland’s champions there high upraised. A pyre they builded on the plain standing; there naked lay the Niflung lords. Flames were mounting, fire was roaring, reek was swirling ringed with tumult. Smoke was fading, sunk was burning; windblown ashes were wafted cold. A hall was thronging, Huns were drinking the funeral feast of fallen men. Foes were vanquished, fire had burned them; now Atli was lord of East and West. Wealth he dealt there, wounds requiting, worthy weregild of warriors slain. Loud they praised him; long the drinking, wild grew the words of the wine-bemused. Gudrún came forth goblets bearing: Gudrún ‘Hail, O Hun-king, hear me speaking: My brethren are slain that I begged of thee. Erp and Eitill dost thou ask to look on? Ask no longer – their end hath come! Their hearts thou tastest with honey mingled, their blood was blent in the bowls I gave; those bowls their skulls bound with silver, their bones thy hounds have burst with teeth.’ There awful cries of anguish woke; their heads men hid their horror shrouding. Pale grew Atli, as one poison-sick, on his face crashed he fallen swooning. To bed they brought him in bower empty, laid him and left him to loathsome dream. Women were wailing, wolves were howling, hounds were baying the hornéd moon. In came Gudrún with ghastly eyes, darkly mantled, dire of purpose. Atli ‘Grímhild’s daughter ghastly-handed, hounds should tear thee and to hell send thee! Stoned and branded at the stake living thou shouldst burn and wither thou born of witch!’ Gudrún mocked him, gasping left him. Fires she kindled, flames she brandished; the house was roaring, hounds were yelping. Timbers crumbled, trees and rafters; there sank and died slaves and maidens. Smoke was swirling over sleeping town, light was lifted over land and tree. Women were weeping, wolves were yammering, hounds were howling in the Hun-kingdom. Thus Atli ended earth forsaking, to the Niflungs’ bane the night was come; of Völsung, Niflung, of vows broken, of woe and valour are the words ended. * While world lasteth shall the words linger, while men are mindful of the mighty days. The woe of Gudrún while world lasteth till end of days all shall hearken. Her mind wavered, her mood grew cold; her heart withered and hate sickened. Life she hated, yet life took not, witless wandering in the woods alone. Over wan rivers, over woods and forests, over rocks she roamed to the roaring sea. In the waves she cast her, the waves spurned her; by the waves sitting she woe bemoaned. Gudrún ‘Of gold were the days, gleaming silver, silver gleaming ere Sigurd came. A maid was I then, a maiden fair; only dreams vexed me, dreams of evil. Fell sorrows five hath fate sent me: they slew Sigurd, my sorrow greatest. In evil loathing to Atli me gave: too long lasting my life’s disease. The heart of Högni they hewed living: my heart it hardened, my hardest woe. Gunnar heard I in the grave crying: my grief most grim was that ghastly voice. My sons I slew seared with madness: keen it bites me most clinging woe. There sits beside me son nor daughter; the world is empty, the waves are cold. They slew Sigurd: my sorrow deepest, my life’s loathing, my life’s disease. Sigurd, Sigurd, on swift Grani lay saddle and bridle and seek for me! Rememberest thou what on marriage-bed in love we pledged, as we laid us down? – the light I would leave to look for thee, from hell thou wouldst ride and haste to me!’ In the waves she cast her, the waves took her; in the wan water her woe was drowned. While the world lasteth woe of Gudrún till the end of days all shall hearken. * Thus glory endeth, and gold fadeth, on noise and clamours the night falleth. Lift up your hearts, lords and maidens for the song of sorrow that was sung of old.","Gram,Horn,Grim",Mirkwood,

In Atlamál, on the other hand, neither Gunnar nor Högni are shown to hesitate at all. The runic message that replaced the wolf’s hair of Atlakviða causes them no disquiet. It is only subsequently that Högni’s wife Kostbera examines the runes and perceives that they have been overlaid on those originally cut; but Högni dismisses her warning, as he also dismisses her warning dreams. Gunnar’s wife Glaumvör likewise has oppressive dreams, but they too are dismissed by Gunnar; and the brothers set out next morning. Kostbera and Glaumvör appear only in Atlamál and are not taken up into the Lay of Gudrún.",,,

Gunnar’s scorn for Atli’s offer and Högni’s warning about the wolf’s hair are preserved, but Gunnar is now persuaded to accept the invitation by the ostensible meaning of Gudrún’s runic message (45). It is Grímhild, not Kostbera, who warns that the runes have been tampered with, and that the underlying meaning was quite other – and this leads Gunnar to tell Vingi that he will not now come (49). This is the occasion of Vingi’s final seduction (51–2); and though Högni remains scornfully unconvinced (53–4), Gunnar, who had ‘deep drunken’, cries out echoing the words of Atlakviða: ‘Let wolves then wield wealth of Niflungs!’",,,

In the Lay, following Atlakviða, Gunnar used his hands.

A great cry of horror and noise of weeping arose from the benches, but Gudrún did not weep: ‘she scattered gold, with red rings enriched the men of her household.... Atli unsuspecting had drunk himself bemused; weapons he had not, he was not ware of Gudrún’ (this last phrase is my father’s translation of a Norse verb of uncertain meaning here).

It is the downfall, too, of a people that had already had an adventurous career, and disturbed things in the west by their intrusion and by the rise of a considerable power at Worms.

However, we are probably not far wrong in guessing that there must – quite early – have been some other element than mere misfortune in this tale to give it the fire and vitality it clearly had: living as it did down the centuries. What this was we can hardly guess. Gold? It may well have been that gold, or the acquisition of some treasure (that later still became connected with some renowned legendary gold) was introduced to explain Attila’s attack. Attila (when legend or history is not on his side) is represented as grasping and greedy.

He became essential to it.’ In the eighth century the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon (monk of Monte Cassino) knew Attila as the foe; and from his account it is seen that by then the tradition was that Gundahari was not slain in his own town of Worms, but marched eastwards to meet Attila: and this was an invariable feature of the legend in all its forms.",,,

Attila received the Roman embassy in the village of wooden buildings that was his headquarters, standing in the midst of a vast plain without stone or tree; and Priscus not only narrowly observed the banquet at which Attila presided, and much else, but described it in such sharp detail as to suggest that he took notes at the time of all that he saw. In this unique account of a barbarian banquet in the Heroic Age Priscus described the elaborate and interminable ceremony in which Attila drank to the health of each guest in turn, and the fine feast served on looted silver dishes with looted drinking-cups of silver and gold – in contrast to the unadorned simplicity of Attila, who drank from a wooden cup and ate only meat, on a wooden plate. He described the entertainment provided: there were singers who chanted songs in praise of the great deeds of Attila; there was a madman, and a buffooning dwarf, who aroused loud laughter, but not from Attila, who sat through all this in grim and rigid silence. But when his youngest son Ernac entered the hall Priscus saw that Attila looked at him ‘with softened gaze’ and stroked his face. He asked a Hun who sat beside him for an explanation of this, and he replied that the soothsayers had told Attila that the fortunes of his family would fail, but would be restored to greatness by this son.

In that year Attila moved with a huge army westwards towards the Rhine, mounting an attack on Gaul for which his motives are obscure. The Huns had destroyed the Ostrogothic power in the east in the fourth century, and Attila ruled over a great mixed dominion, as the Goths had done under Ermanaric (see the commentary on the Lay of Gudrún, stanza 86, pp.322–3). In his empire, and so also in his armies, were many East Germanic peoples; and now in his host came the Ostrogoths under their king Valamer, the Gepids under Ardaric, Rugians, Thuringians, and warriors of other nations beside. Against them came in uneasy alliance the Visigoths (the western Goths) of Tolosa (Toulouse) under their aged king Theodoric, Aetius the Roman general, Burgundians from their new lands in Savoy, Franks, even a contingent of Saxons.

In the same way, after the death of Alaric king of the Visigoths in 410, the captives were made to divert the mountain-river Busento in Calabria from its bed, and then after the burial of the king and the returning of the river to its ordinary course they were all put to death.",,,

Among Latin-speaking peoples he was taken up into what has been called ‘ecclesiastical mythology’, and became Flagellum Dei, the Scourge of God, divinely appointed to the devastation of a wicked world. In the lands of Germania there were two radically distinct traditions concerning him: he appears in a double light, generous patron and monstrous foe, and it is not difficult to see how this should have come about. On the Catalaunian plains there was a colossal conflict between men of many Germanic nations. As I have said, in the hosts of Attila went men of many East Germanic peoples subject to the Huns, most notably the Ostrogoths, and for them Attila was the great King and overlord, to whom their own kings paid allegiance: indeed his very name Attila looks like a diminutive form of the Gothic word atta, ‘father’.

Tolkien,§ I Attila and Gundahari,APPENDIX A,,TEXT_STORY,"That my father subscribed to the ‘mythological’ theory in some form is plain; but his view of the process by which the Burgundians became Nibelungs is nowhere clearly or fully expressed in his writings. He had suggested (see this Appendix p.341) that the connection of the ‘Dragon-hero’ with the Burgundian king Gundahari began with ‘gold’ as a motive to explain Attila’s attack (when Attila had become the leader of the Huns in the destruction of the Burgundian kingdom of Worms). As Gundahari faded back into the past (he wrote), old legends of fairy-hoards localized on the Rhine naturally became attached to the famous king in Worms: ‘this treasure probably had demon or dwarvish guardians already, but need not originally have been the same as Sigemund’s gold, though it may well have been.’",,,

Tolkien,§ I Attila and Gundahari,APPENDIX A,,TEXT_EXTRA,"‘It would certainly seem’, he said, ‘that the gold-hero who intrudes into the Burgundians had already gathered round him enemy Niflungar, who robbed him of life, bride, and treasure. The historical Burgundians partly take their place, and though there is never complete fusion they are darkened.’ He also saw it as virtually certain that the Nibelungenlied is the more original ‘in making the demonic and cruel Hagen not a brother, but an associate vaguely connected with the Burgundians. Very likely Hagen/Högni is a relic of some old mythical figure connected originally with the gold, or at any rate with the mythical pre-Burgundian part of the “Sigurd” story.’",,,

Tolkien,§ I Attila and Gundahari,APPENDIX A,,TEXT_EXTRA,"From observations such as these in his notes one can perhaps surmise that my father saw the genesis of the central part of the legend after this fashion. The Dragon-hero was already the robber of the Hoard of the dark, demonic Nibelungs (whom my father expressly saw as ‘the original owners’), and he brought with him into the Burgundian legend the story of how the Nibelungs in revenge slew him, and took the treasure.",,,

Tolkien,§ I Attila and Gundahari,APPENDIX A,,TEXT_EXTRA,"With the fusion of the two legends, the Burgundian princes necessarily became his enemies: he must be killed in order that they should become the possessors of the gold, and they drew into themselves, so to speak, something of the dark Nibelung nature. It was from the ‘Nibelung’ side of the composite legend that the ‘demonic and cruel’ Hagen ultimately came, with (in the Nibelungenlied) his lust for the gold and his guarding it to the death, his relentless hatred of Siegfried leading to his murder. Hagen became more or less assimilated to the Burgundians, and in the Norse (as Högni) wholly so; but the Burgundians on their side became Nibelungs, or Niflungar.",,,

Unloosed at last shall then set forth the ship of shadow from the North; the host of Hel shall cross the sea and Loki shall from chain be free, and with the wolf shall monsters all upon the world then ravening fall. Then Surtur from the South shall fare and tree-devouring fire shall bear that bright as sun on swords shall shine in battle of the hosts divine; the hills of stone shall bend their head; all men the paths of death shall tread. Then darkened shall the sunlight be, and Earth shall founder under sea, and from the cloven heavens all the gleaming stars shall flee and fall; the steam shall rise in roaring spires and heaven’s roof be licked with fires. * A house there is that sees no sun, dark-builded on the beaches dun where cold waves wash the Deadly Shore, and northward looks its shadowy door; the louver poisoned rain lets fall, of woven serpents in the wall. Laden in heavy streams there wade men perjured, men who have betrayed the trust of friend; and there the coward and wolvish murderer is devoured: the dragon who yet Yggdrasil gnaws at the roots there takes his fill. Dim-flying shall that dragon haste over the beaches dark and waste, up from the Nether-fells shall spring bearing those corpses under wing, then plunge, and sea close o’er his head for ever, o’er the doomed and dead. * At last once more uprising slow the Earth from Ocean green shall grow, and falls of water shimmering pour from her high shoulders to the shore; the eagle there with lonely cry shall hunt the fish on mountains high. The younger gods again shall meet in Idavellir’s pastures sweet, and tales shall tell of ancient doom, the Serpent and the fire and gloom, and that old king of Gods recall his might and wisdom ere the fall. There marvellous shall again be found cast in the grass upon the ground the golden chess wherewith they played when Ásgard long ago was made, when all their courts were filled with gold in the first merriment of old. A house I see that standeth there bright-builded, than the Sun more fair: o’er Gimlé shine its tiles of gold, its halls no grief nor evil hold, and there shall worthy men and true in living days delight pursue.
