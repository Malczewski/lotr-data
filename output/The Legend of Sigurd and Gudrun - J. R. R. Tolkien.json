Since 1639 Brynj\u00f3lfr had been bishop of Sk\u00e1laholt in Iceland, and had been a keen collector of manuscripts. Torf\u00e6us was commissioned to get his help in collecting for the king materials for ancient history, and any antiquities, curiosities, or rarities that could be found in Iceland. In 1663 the bishop sent the choicest of his collection to the king. Among these now priceless treasures was the Codex Regius. Where the bishop had found it, or what was its previous history is unknown, except that he had picked it up twenty years earlier: for on the front page he had written his monogram and a date (LL 1643, i.e. Lupus Loricatus = Brynj\u00f3lfr), just as we should scrawl our name and a date on a new and interesting acquisition from a second-hand bookshop.",

In those days poets complained of the tyranny of Edda, or offered apologies for their lack of proficiency in the art of Edda. In the words of Gudbrand Vigf\u00fasson: \u2018An untaught poet who called a spade a spade, instead of describing it by a mythological circumlocution, would be scouted as \u201cEddaless\u201d\u2019 (Eddu-lauss, \u2018having no Eddaic art\u2019).

Him V\u00f6lsung followed valiant-hearted, child of longing, chosen of \u00d3din. Valkyrie fair did V\u00f6lsung wed, \u00d3din\u2019s maiden, \u00d3din\u2019s chosen. Sigmund and Sign\u00fd, a son and daughter, she bare at a birth in his builded halls. High rose their roofs, huge their timbers, and wide the walls of wood carven. A tree there towered tall and branching, that house upholding, the hall\u2019s wonder; its leaves their hangings, its limbs rafters, its mighty bole in the midst standing. * V\u00f6lsung \u2018What sails be these in the seas shining? What ships be those with shields golden?\u2019 V\u00f6lsung \u2018Wherefore grievous? Are guests hateful? Gautland\u2019s master glorious reigneth.\u2019 Birds sang blithely o\u2019er board and hearth, bold men and brave on benches sitting. Mailclad, mighty, his message spake there a Gautish lord gleaming-harnessed. Gaut \u2018Siggeir sent me swiftly steering: fame of V\u00f6lsung far is rumoured. Sign\u00fd\u2019s beauty, Sign\u00fd\u2019s wisdom, to his bed he wooeth, bride most lovely.\u2019 V\u00f6lsung \u2018What saith Sigmund? Shall his sister go with lord so mighty league to bind us?\u2019 Ere summer faded sails came shining, ships came shoreward with shields gleaming. Many and mighty mailclad warriors to the seats of V\u00f6lsung with Siggeir strode. Birds sang blissful over boards laden, over Sign\u00fd pale, Siggeir eager. Dark wine they drank, doughty princes, Gautland\u2019s chieftains; glad their voices. Wan night cometh; wind ariseth; doors are opened, the din is silenced. A man there enters, mantled darkly, hoary-bearded, huge and ancient. A sword he sweeps from swathing cloak, into standing stem stabs it swiftly: Doors clanged backward; din was wakened; men leapt forward mighty-handed. Gaut and V\u00f6lsung glory seeking strove they starkly, straining vainly. Sigmund latest seized it lightly, the blade from bole brandished flaming. Siggeir yearning on that sword gazing red gold offered, ransom kingly. Sigmund \u2018Though seas of silver and sands of gold thou bade in barter, thy boon were vain! To my hand made, for me destined, I sell no sword to Siggeir ever.\u2019 * Sign\u00fd \u2018My heart is heavy my home leaving! Sign\u00fd\u2019s wisdom Sign\u00fd burdens. From this wedding waketh woe and evil \u2013 break, sire, the bonds thou hast bound me in!\u2019 V\u00f6lsung \u2018Woe and evil are woman\u2019s boding! Fate none can flee. Faith man can hold. Ships await thee! Shame to sunder the bridal bed, the bounden word. Sign\u00fd \u2018Sigmund, farewell! Siggeir calls me. Weak might hath woman for wisdom\u2019s load. Last night I lay where loath me was; with less liking I may lay me yet.\u2019 \u2018Hail! toft and Tree, timbers carven! Maid here was once who is mournful queen.\u2019 Wild blew the wind waves white-crested. On land of V\u00f6lsung she looked no more. * A ship came shining to shores foaming, gloomy Gautland\u2019s guarded havens. Sigmund lordly, sire and kindred, to fair feasting fearless journeyed. Sign\u00fd \u2018Father V\u00f6lsung, fairest kinsman! Back my brethren! This beach tread not! A bitter drinking, baleful meeting, swords hath Siggeir set to greet you.\u2019 With thousand thanes, thronging spearmen, his guests welcomed Gautland\u2019s master. Ten times V\u00f6lsung towering wrathful casque and corslet clove asunder. Through and through them thrice went Sigmund; as grass in Gautland grimly mowed them. His shield he shed: with shining sword smoking redly slew two-handed. * Black the raven by the body croaketh, bare are V\u00f6lsung\u2019s bones once mighty. In bonds the brethren are bound living; Siggeir smileth, Sign\u00fd weeps not. Sign\u00fd \u2018Sweet still is sight while see one may! A boon, my husband \u2013 bid men linger! Slay not swiftly seed of V\u00f6lsung! For death is lasting, though the doom tarry.\u2019 Siggeir \u2018Wild and witless words of Sign\u00fd, that pain and torment plead for kindred! Glad will I grant it, grimly bind them in the forest fettered, faint and hungry.\u2019 In the forest fettered, faint and naked, her ten brethren torment suffered. There one by one a wolf rent them; by night after night another sought she. Sign\u00fd \u2018What found ye in the forest, my fair servants?\u2019 * Sign\u00fd \u2018Who hath deeply delved this dark cavern? Dwarvish master, thy doors open!\u2019 Brother and sister in a bed lying, brief love, bitter, blent with loathing! Answer, earth-dweller \u2013 in thy arms who lies, chill, enchanted, changed, elfshapen? Back went Sign\u00fd to Siggeir\u2019s hall, nine months brooding no word speaking. Wolves were wailing, her women shuddering, Sign\u00fd silent, when a son she bore. * Sigmund \u2018Who calls so clear at cavern\u2019s doorway, fords so fearless the foaming stream? Fair one, thy father thy face gave not! What bringest bound in bast folded?\u2019 Sinfj\u00f6tli \u2018My face is V\u00f6lsung\u2019s, father of Sign\u00fd. Sign\u00fd sent me a sword bearing. Long years it lay on the lap of Siggeir; Sigmund drew it, since hath no man.\u2019 Thus son of Sign\u00fd came Sinfj\u00f6tli, to vengeance bred of V\u00f6lsung slain. In the forest faring far in warfare long they laboured, long they waited. Wide they wandered wolvish-coated, men they murdered, men they plundered. Daylong slept they in dark cavern after dreadful deeds of death in Gautland. Moon was shining, men were singing, Siggeir sitting in his sounding hall. V\u00f6lsung vanquished voices chanted; wolves came howling wild and dreadful. Doors were opened, din fell silent. Sigmund stood there his sword wielding, and Sign\u00fd\u2019s son at his side laughing. Sigmund \u2018Come forth, Sign\u00fd, sister fairest! Gautland\u2019s glory grimly endeth. Glad the greeting, grief is over; avenged is V\u00f6lsung valiant-hearted!\u2019 Sign\u00fd (Sigmund\u2019s sister Sign\u00fd answered:) \u2018Son Sinfj\u00f6tli, Sigmund father! Sign\u00fd comes not, Siggeir calls her. Where I lay unwilling I now lay me glad; I lived in loathing, now lief I die.\u2019 * Long ruled Sigmund, sire and uncle; Sinfj\u00f6tli sat at his side proudly. There towered the tree, tall and ancient, birds in the branches were blithe again. Ever Gr\u00edmnir\u2019s gift gleamed in warfare; at Sigmund\u2019s side Sinfj\u00f6tli strode. Hard, handlink\u00e9d, helm and corslet glasswhite glittered with grey silver. Seven kings they slew, their cities plundered; wide waxed their realm the world over. Of women fairest in war taken a wife took Sigmund; woe she brought him. Sinfj\u00f6tli came sailing proudly ships goldladen to the shore steering. In came the queen evil pondering \u2013 her sire was slain by Sinfj\u00f6tli \u2013 : Steep stands the horn, Stepson thirsty!\u2019 Queen \u2018Beer I bring thee brown and potent!\u2019 Queen \u2018Ale I offer thee, eager V\u00f6lsung! V\u00f6lsungs valiant at venom blench not; heroes ask not help in drinking \u2013 if drink thou darest, drink Sinfj\u00f6tli!\u2019 Dead Sinfj\u00f6tli drinking stumbled. There sorrowladen Sigmund raised him, in arms caught him; out he wandered. Over wood and wild to the waves foaming witless strayed he to the waves roaring. Boatman \u2018Whither bringest thou thy burden heavy? My boat is ready to bear it hence.\u2019 A man there steered, mantled darkly, hooded and hoary, huge and awful. Alone was Sigmund by the land\u2019s margin; in Valh\u00f6llu V\u00f6lsung feasted: * Old was Sigmund, as an oak gnarl\u00e9d; his beard was grey as bark of ash. Young was Sigrlinn and yellow-gleaming her locks hung long on lissom shoulder. Seven sons of kings sued the maiden: Sigmund took her; sails were hoisted. The V\u00f6lsung land they viewed afar, the windy cliffs, the waves foaming. Sigmund \u2018Say me, Sigrlinn, sweeter were it young king to wed and yellow-bearded, or wife of a V\u00f6lsung, the World\u2019s chosen in my bed to bear, bride of \u00d3din?\u2019 * High sang the horns, helms were gleaming, shafts were shaken, shields them answered. Vikings\u2019 standards, V\u00f6lsung\u2019s banner on strand were streaming; stern the onslaught. Old was Sigmund as the oak gnarl\u00e9d; his sword swung he smoking redly. Fate him fended fearless striding with dew of battle dyed to shoulder. A warrior strange, one-eyed, awful, strode and stayed him standing silent, huge and hoary and hooded darkly. The sword of Sigmund sang before him. His spear he raised: sprang asunder the sword of Gr\u00edmnir, singing splintered. The king is fallen cloven-breasted; lords lie round him; the land darkens. Men were moaning, the moon sinking. Sigrlinn sought him, sadly raised him: Sigmund \u2018From wanhope many have been won to life, yet healing I ask not. Hope is needless. \u00d3din calls me at the end of days. Here lies not lost the last V\u00f6lsung! Thy womb shall wax with the World\u2019s chosen, serpent-slayer, seed of \u00d3din. Till ages end all shall name him chief of chieftains, changeless glory. Of Gr\u00edmnir\u2019s gift guard the fragments; of the shards shall be shaped a shining blade. Too soon shall I see Sigurd bear it to glad Valh\u00f6ll greeting \u00d3din.\u2019 Cold came morning o\u2019er the king lifeless and woeful Sigrlinn her watch keeping. Ships came sailing to the shore crowding, rovers northern to the red beaches The bride of Sigmund as a bondwoman over sounding seas sadly journeyed. Wild blew the winds, waves them lifted; she viewed afar the V\u00f6lsung land. Wind was wailing, waves were crying, Sigrlinn sorrowful, when a son she bore. Sigurd golden as a sun shining, forth came he fair in a far country. Woman \u2018O woman woeful in war taken, who was thy husband while his house lasted? What father begot such fair offspring? \u2013 grey steel glitters in his gleaming eyes.\u2019 Sigrlinn \u2018The sire of Sigurd Sigmund V\u00f6lsung; Seed of \u00d3din songs shall call him.\u2019 *",

Regin dwelt now in the forest and was deemed wise in many other matters than smithwork. Regin egged Sigurd to slay F\u00e1fnir. With the sword Gram and the horse Grani, of which it is here spoken, he accomplished this, though Regin had concealed from him both the great power of F\u00e1fnir and the nature of the hoard that the serpent guarded. Here also are given the dark words of Regin in which the undermeaning is that the real cause of the serpent\u2019s death is Regin, who should therefore have the gold (though this he has promised, at least in large share, to Sigurd); but that Regin should slay the slayer of his brother. Sigurd deeming him only weighed with the thought of his guilt in brother-murder, dismisses his words with scorn. Nor does Sigurd heed the dragon\u2019s words concerning the curse, thinking them merely the device of greed to protect the gold even though its guardian be slain. This indeed was the dragon\u2019s chief purpose in revealing the curse at the hour of his death. Yet that curse began to work swiftly.",

            "TEXT": "The forge was smoking in the forest-darkness; there wrought Regin by the red embers. There was Sigurd sent, seed of V\u00f6lsung, lore deep to learn; long his fostering. Runes of wisdom then Regin taught him, and weapons\u2019 wielding, works of mastery; the language of lands, lore of kingship, wise words he spake in the wood\u2019s fastness. Regin \u2018Full well couldst thou wield wealth and kingship, O son of Sigmund, a sire\u2019s treasure.\u2019 Regin \u2018A hoard have I heard on a heath lying, gold more glorious than greatest king\u2019s. Wealth and worship would wait on thee, if thou durst to deal with its dragon master.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Men sing of serpents ceaseless guarding gold and silver greedy-hearted; but fell F\u00e1fnir folk all name him of dragons direst, dreaming evil.\u2019 Regin \u2018Dragons all are dire to the dull-hearted; yet venom feared not V\u00f6lsung\u2019s children.\u2019 * Regin \u2018The falls of Andvari frothed and spouted with fish teeming in foaming pools. There Otr sported, mine own brother; to snare salmon sweet he thought it. With stone smote him, stripped him naked, a robber roving ruthless-handed; at Hreidmar\u2019s house hailed my father, that fairest fell for food offered. There wrought Regin by the red embers rough iron hewing and runes marking; there F\u00e1fnir lay by the fire sleeping, fell-hearted son, fiercely dreaming. (Hreidmar) \u201cRedgolden rings, ransom costly, this fell must fill, this fur cover.\u201d From the foaming force as a fish netted was Dwarf Andvari dragged and plundered. All must Andvari, all surrender, light rings and heavy, or life itself. In Hreidmar\u2019s house heaped he laid them, gold ring on gold, a great weregild. (Regin & F\u00e1fnir) \u201cShall not brethren share in brother\u2019s ransom their grief to gladden? \u2013 gold is healing.\u201d Then F\u00e1fnir\u2019s heart fiercely stung him; Hreidmar he hewed in his house asleep. F\u00e1fnir\u2019s heart as a fire burneth: part nor portion he pays to Regin. In dragon\u2019s likeness darkling lies he; deep his dungeons, and dread he knows not. A helm of horror his head weareth on Gnitahei\u00f0i grimly creeping.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018With kin unkindly wert thou cursed Regin! His fire and venom affright me not! Yet why thou eggest me, I ask thee still \u2013 for father\u2019s vengeance, or for F\u00e1fnir\u2019s gold?\u2019 Regin \u2018A sire avenged were sweet to Regin; the gold thy guerdon, the glory thine. A sword for Sigurd will the smith fashion, the blade most bitter ever borne to war.\u2019 * The forge was smoking, the fire smouldered. Two swords there fashioned twice he broke them: hard the anvil hewed he mightily \u2013 sword was splintered, smith was angered. Sigurd \u2018Sigrlinn, say me, was sooth told me of gleaming shards of Gr\u00edmnir\u2019s sword? Sigmund\u2019s son now seeks them from thee \u2013 now Gram shall Regin guileless weld me!\u2019 The forge was flaring, the fire blazing: a blade they brought him with blue edges; they flickered with flame, as it flashed singing \u2013 the cloven anvil clashed asunder. The Rhine river ran by swiftly; there tufts of wool on the tide he cast. Sharp it shore them in the sheer water: glad grew Sigurd, Gram there brandished. Sigurd \u2018Where lies the heath and hoard golden? Now rede me Regin of roads thither!\u2019 In Busiltarn ran blue the waters, green grew the grass for grazing horse. A man them minded mantled darkly, hoary-bearded, huge and ancient. They drove the horses into deep currents; to the bank they backed from the bitter water. But grey Grani gladly swam there: Sigurd chose him, swift and flawless. Man \u2018In the stud of Sleipnir, steed of \u00d3din, was sired this horse, swiftest, strongest. Ride now! ride now! rocks and mountains, horse and hero, hope of \u00d3din!\u2019 * Gand rode Regin and Grani Sigurd; the waste lay withered, wide and empty. Fathoms thirty fell the fearful cliff whence the dragon bowed him drinking thirsty. In deep hollow on the dark hillside long there lurked he; the land trembled. Forth came F\u00e1fnir, fire his breathing; down the mountain rushed mists of poison. The fire and fume over fearless head rushed by roaring; rocks were groaning. The black belly, bent and coiling, over hidden hollow hung and glided. Gram was brandished; grimly ringing to the hoary stone heart it sundered. In F\u00e1fnir\u2019s throe were threshed as flails his writhing limbs and reeking head. Black flowed the blood, belching drenched him; in the hollow hiding hard grew Sigurd. Swift now sprang he sword withdrawing: there each saw other with eyes of hate. F\u00e1fnir \u2018O man of mankind! What man begot thee? Who forged the flame for F\u00e1fnir\u2019s heart?\u2019 F\u00e1fnir \u2018A wolf was thy sire \u2013 full well I know it! Who egged thee eager to mine undoing?\u2019 F\u00e1fnir \u2018Nay! Regin wrought this, rogue and master! O son of Sigmund! sooth I tell thee: my guarded gold gleams with evil, bale it bringeth to both my foes.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Life each must leave on his latest day, yet gold gladly will grasp living!\u2019 Sigurd \u2018A fool, saith Sigurd, could not fend himself with helm of horror \u2013 hell now seize him!\u2019 In the heather had hidden as a hare cowering the fear-daunted smith; forth now crept he. Regin \u2018Hail! O V\u00f6lsung victory-crown\u00e9d, of mortal men mightiest hero!\u2019 Regin \u2018Yet glad is Sigurd, of gold thinking, as Gram on the grey grass he wipeth! \u2018Twas blood of my brother that blade did spill, though somewhat the slaying I myself must share.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Far enow thou fleddest, when F\u00e1fnir came. This sword slew him, and Sigurd\u2019s prowess.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Nay, blame not thyself, backward helper! Stout heart is better than strongest sword.\u2019 Thus heavy spake Regin Ridil unsheathing, fell F\u00e1fnir\u2019s heart from the flesh cleaving. Dark blood drank he from the dragon welling; deep drowsing fell on dwarvish smith. Regin \u2018Sit now, Sigurd! Sleep o\u2019ercomes me. Thou F\u00e1fnir\u2019s heart at the fire roast me. His dark thought\u2019s dwelling after drink potent I fain would eat, feast of wisdom.\u2019 Sharp spit shaped he; at shining fire the fat of F\u00e1fnir there frothed and hissed. To tongue he touched testing finger \u2013 beasts\u2019 cry he knew, and birds\u2019 voices. * first bird \u2018A head shorter should hoary liar go hence to nether hell! The heart of F\u00e1fnir I whole would eat if I myself were Sigurd.\u2019 second bird \u2018Who a foe lets free is fool indeed, when he was bane of brother! I alone would be lord of link\u00e9d gold, if my wielded sword had won it.\u2019 first bird \u2018A head shorter should hiding dwarf deprived of gold perish! There Regin rouses in rustling heather; Vengeance he vows for brother.\u2019 * Round turned Sigurd, and Regin saw he in the heath crawling with hate gleaming. Black spilled the blood as blade clove him, the head hewing of Hreidmar\u2019s son. Dark red the drink and dire the meat whereon Sigurd feasted seeking wisdom. Dark hung the doors and dread the timbers in the earth under of iron builded. Gold piled on gold there glittered palely: that gold was glamoured with grim curses. The Helm of Horror on his head laid he: swart fell the shadow round Sigurd standing. Great and grievous was Grani\u2019s burden, yet lightly leaped he down the long mountain. Ride now! ride now road and woodland, horse and hero, hope of \u00d3din! * Ever wild and wide the wandering paths; long lay the shadow of lone rider. Birds in the branches blithe were singing: their words he heard, their wit he knew not. Raven \u2018High stands a hall on Hindarfell, fire it fenceth flaming-tongu\u00e9d; steep stands the path, stern the venture, where mountains beckon to mighty heart.\u2019 Finch \u2018A maid have I seen as morning fair, golden-girdled, garland-crown\u00e9d. Green run the roads to Gj\u00faki\u2019s land; fate leads them on, who fare that way.\u2019 Raven \u2018Slumber bindeth the sun-maiden on mountain high, mail about her. Thorn of \u00d3din is thrust in bosom \u2013 to what shall she wake, woe or laughter?\u2019 Finch \u2018The Gj\u00fakings proudly, Gunnar and H\u00f6gni, there rule a realm by Rhine-water. Gudr\u00fan groweth golden-lovely, as flower unfolded fair at morning.\u2019 Raven \u2018Too peerless proud her power wielding, victory swaying as Valkyrie, she heard nor heeded hests of \u00d3din, and \u00d3din smote whom \u00d3din loved.\u2019",

A fire at crown, fence of lightning, high to heavenward hissed and wavered. Greyfell Grani, glory seeking, leaped the lightning lightning-sinewed. A wall saw Sigurd of woven shields, a standard streaming striped with silver; a man there war-clad, mailclad, lying, with sword beside him, sleeping deadly. The helm he lifted: hair fell shining, a woman lay there wound in slumber; fast her corslet as on flesh growing \u2013 the gleaming links, Gram there clave them. * Brynhild awakening \u2018Hail! O Daylight and Day\u2019s children! Hail, Night and Noon and Northern Star! Hail, Kingly Gods, Queens of \u00c1sgard! Hail, Earth\u2019s bosom all-abounding! Hands of healing, hear and grant us, light in darkness, life and wisdom; to both give triumph, truth unfailing, to both in gladness glorious meeting!\u2019 * Brynhild \u2018Brynhild greets thee, O brave and fair! What prince hath pierced my pale fetters?\u2019 Brynhild \u2018\u00d3din bound me, \u00d3din\u2019s chosen; no more to battle, to mate doomed me. An oath I uttered for ever lasting, to wed but one, the World\u2019s chosen.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018In the halls of \u00d3din it were hard to choose man there mightiest, most renown\u00e9d.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Seed of \u00d3din is Sigmund\u2019s child, and Sigurd\u2019s sword is serpent\u2019s bane.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Hail, bright and splendid! Hail, battle-maiden, bride of V\u00f6lsung Brynhild chosen!\u2019 Troth in triumph twain there plighted alone on mountain; light was round them. Brynhild \u2018A beaker I bring thee, O battle-wielder, mighty-blended mead of glory, brimmed with bounty, blessed with healing, and rimmed with runes of running laughter.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018I drink, all daring: doom or glory; drink of splendour dear the bearer!\u2019 Sigurd \u2018I flee nor flinch, though fey standing, words of wisdom, woe, or gladness.\u2019 Be slow to vengeance, seed of V\u00f6lsung! In swearing soothfast, the sworn holding. Grim grow the boughs in guile rooted; fair flowers the tree in faith planted! Where the witch-hearted walks or houses linger not, lodge not, though lone the road! Though beauty blindeth bright as morning, let no daughter of kings thy dreams master! Hail, Sigmund\u2019s son! Swift thy glory, yet a cloud meseems creepeth nigh thee. Long life, I fear, lies not before thee, but strife and storm stand there darkly.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Hail, Brynhild wise! Bright thy splendour though fate be strong to find its end. Faith ever will I hold firm, unyielding, though strife and storm stand about me.\u2019 Faith then they vowed fast, unyielding, there each to each in oaths binding. Bliss there was born when Brynhild woke; yet fate is strong to find its end. * Ever wild and wide the wandering paths; on roads shining went riders two. High towered the helm; hair flowed in wind; mail glinted bright on mountain dark. Brynhild \u2018Here, Sigmund\u2019s son, swift and fearless, is our way\u2019s parting, to woe or joy. Here, lord, I leave thee, to my land turning; hence Grani bears thee glory seeking.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Why, Brynhild wise, bride of V\u00f6lsung, when at one are the riders do our ways sunder?\u2019 To her land she turned lonely shining; green ran the roads that Grani strode. To her land she came, long the waiting; in Gj\u00faki\u2019s house glad the singing. * Gudr\u00fan \u2018O mother, hear me! Mirth is darkened, dreams have troubled me, dreams of boding.\u2019 Gudr\u00fan \u2018No wind, nor wraith of waking thought \u2013 a hart we hunted over hill and valley; all would take him, \u2019twas I caught him: his hide was golden, his horns towering. A woman wildly on the wind riding with a shaft stung him, shooting pierced him; at my knees he fell in night of woe, my heart too heavy might I hardly bear. A wolf they gave me for woe\u2019s comfort; in my brethren\u2019s blood he bathed me red. Dreams have vexed me, direst boding, not wind or weather or waning moon.\u2019 Gr\u00edmhild \u2018Dreams oft token the dark by light, good by evil, Gudr\u00fan daughter! Lift up thine eyes eager shining! Green lie the lands round Gj\u00faki\u2019s house.\u2019 Gudr\u00fan \u2018The roads run green to the Rhine-water! Who rides here lone, arrayed for war? His helm is high, his horse fleeting, his shield is shining with sheen of gold!\u2019 Thus Gudr\u00fan gazed, Gj\u00faki\u2019s daughter, from wall and window in wonder looking. Thus Sigurd rode, seed of V\u00f6lsung, into Gj\u00faki\u2019s courts gleaming-harnessed. There Gj\u00faki dwelt his gold dealing in Niflung land, the Niflung lord. Gunnar and H\u00f6gni were Gj\u00faki\u2019s sons, mighty princes; men them hearkened. There Gr\u00edmhild dwelt, guileful in counsel, grimhearted queen grey with wisdom, with lore of leechcraft, lore of poison, with chill enchantment and with changing spells. As ravens dark were those raven-friends; fair their faces, fierce their glances. With Huns they waged hate and warfare, gold ever gathering in great dungeons. Silent they sat when Sigurd entered Gunnar greeting, Gj\u00faki hailing. Sigurd \u2018The son of Sigmund, Sigurd V\u00f6lsung, a king\u2019s son cometh to kingly house. Fame of Niflungs far is rumoured, not yet hath faded fame of V\u00f6lsung.\u2019 There swift for Sigurd seat was ordered; the feast grew fair, folk were mirthful. There Gunnar grasped his golden harp; while songs he sang silence fell there. Of these things sang Gunnar By mighty Mirkwood on the marches of the East the great Goth-kings in glory ruled. By Danpar-banks was dread warfare with the hosts of Hunland, horsemen countless. Horsemen countless hastened westward; the Borgund lords met Budli\u2019s host. In Budli\u2019s brother their blades reddened the glad Gj\u00fakings, gold despoiling. Of these things sang Sigurd Then Sigurd seized the sounding harp; hushed they hearkened in the hall listening. The waste lay withered wide and empty; forth came F\u00e1fnir, fire around him. Dark hung the doors on deep timbers; gold piled on gold there glittered wanly. The hoard was plundered, helm was lifted, and Grani greyfell grievous burdened. High Hindarfell, hedged with lightning, mountain mighty from mists uprose. Brynhild wakened, bright her splendour \u2013 song fell silent, and Sigurd ended. By Gj\u00faki\u2019s chair Gr\u00edmhild hearkened, of Gudr\u00fan thinking and the golden hoard. Gunnar and H\u00f6gni gladly bade him in league and love long to dwell there. * The Borgund lords their battle furnished; banners were broidered, blades were sharpened. White shone hauberks, helms were burnished; under horses\u2019 hooves Hunland trembled. Grim was Gunnar on Goti riding; under haughty H\u00f6gni H\u00f6lkvir strode; but fleeter was Grani, foal of Sleipnir; flamed all before the fire of Sigurd. Foes were vanquished, fields were wasted, grimly garnered Gram the harvest. Where Gj\u00fakings rode glory won they, ever glory Sigurd greater conquered. Wide waxed their realm in world of old; Dane-king they slew, doughty princes. Dread fell on folk; doom they wielded; victory rode ever with the V\u00f6lsung lord. High they honoured him, in heart loved him, Hun-gold gave him in the hall sitting. But his heart remembered house of V\u00f6lsung, and Sigmund slain on sands afar. A host he gathered, help of Gj\u00fakings; to the sea he rode and sails hoisted. His ship was shining with shields and mail; it was dragon-headed, dire and golden. As fire and tempest to his father\u2019s land came Sigurd sailing; the sand was reddened. Clashed the cloven casque and hauberk; shields were splintered, shorn was corslet. Men learned there lived yet line of V\u00f6lsung! Now of V\u00f6lsung land was a V\u00f6lsung lord. But the house once high was hollow, roofless; the limbs were rotten of their leafy tree. A man there walked mantled darkly, his beard was flowing, and blind his eye: Where Sigmund drew sword of Gr\u00edmnir, Gram shall shine not. Go thou, V\u00f6lsung! Now king thou art of kings begotten, a bride calls thee over billowing seas.\u2019 * His fleet went forth with flaming sails; goldladen ships came glad to shore. Steeds went striding, stonefire glinted, horns were sounded; home rode Sigurd. A feast they fashioned, far proclaimed it, their highroofed halls hung with splendour; boards and beakers, benches, gilded; mead poured and ale from morn to eve. A king sat Sigurd: carven silver, raiment gleaming, rings and goblets, dear things dealt he, doughty-handed, his friends enriching, fame upraising. (There spake Gr\u00edmhild to Gj\u00faki\u2019s ear:) Gr\u00edmhild \u2018How long shall last league unbounden? Here is worthiest lord of world\u2019s renown! Were a daughter offered, he would dwell for ever, our strength in strife, standing bulwark.\u2019 Gj\u00faki \u2018The gifts of kings are gold and silver; their daughters fair are dearly wooed!\u2019 Sigurd sat silent; the singing heard not but in heart Brynhild bright with splendour: \u2018A queen was I once, and a king shall wed.\u2019 Soon, thought he, soon I will seek my own. * Gr\u00edmhild went forth to guarded bower; deep horn she filled that was darkly written. She drink of power dreadly blended; it had strength of stone, it was stained with blood. Gr\u00edmhild \u2018Hail, guest and king! Good go with thee! Drink now deeply dear love\u2019s token! A father hast thou found, and fond mother, brothers sit nigh thee. O bravest, hail!\u2019 Deep drank Sigurd, drained it laughing, then sat unsmiling, the singing heard not. In came Gudr\u00fan gleaming-rob\u00e9d, as flower unfolded fair at morning. Sigurd wondered, silent gazing; his mind was glamoured, mood confounded. * Brynhild abode a blossomed summer, homing harvest, hoary winter. A year followed year; yearning seized her: the king came not; cold weighed her heart. Of her wealth and splendour wide spread the word; kings came riding, her courts thronging. Her mood was troubled, her mind darkened; fell greeting found they, and few returned. One armed and mantled as ancient king wild steed there rode than wind fleeter. Spear upholding spiked with lightning her hall he entered, hailed her darkly: King \u2018Bond unbroken shall be bounden oath, dreed and endured be doom appointed. Brynhild full soon shall bridal drink; choosing not the slain, shall choose the living. Brynhild must drink the bridal feast, ere winters two o\u2019er the world be passed. A queen thou wert, a king shalt wed: \u00d3din dooms it; \u00d3din hearken!\u2019 Fire forth blossomed, flames were kindled, high up-leaping hissed and wavered. In hall standing hedged with lightning, \u2018one only\u2019, thought she \u2018can enter now!\u2019 * In Gj\u00faki\u2019s house glad the singing. A feast they fashioned, far men sought it. To blissful Gudr\u00fan the bridal drank there golden Sigurd glorious shining. Morning woke with mirth, merry came evening; harp-strings were plucked by hands of cunning; mead poured and ale, men were joyful, of peerless kings praise uplifting. Oaths swore Sigurd for ever lasting, a bond of brotherhood in blood mingled, help in venture, in hate and battle, in need and desire, nowhere failing. Gunnar and H\u00f6gni gladly swore it, as Gr\u00edmhild counselled grey with wisdom. Gunnar and H\u00f6gni good they deemed it; glad was Gudr\u00fan gleaming-lovely. Gudr\u00fan walked in joy, gladness round her; mornings came with mirth, mirth at sleeping. Sigurd dwelt as king sweet days and nights; high hope he had, yet in heart a shadow. * Wide went the word of woman mighty, of Brynhild queen bright in splendour. Gr\u00edmhild hearkened, grimly pondered, of Gunnar thinking and of Gj\u00faki\u2019s power. Gr\u00edmhild \u2018Hail, Gj\u00faki\u2019s son! Good go with thee! Fair flowers thy state, thy fame riseth. Who could woo as he wills, a wife yet lacketh, though his might few match, or might of friends.\u2019 Gunnar \u2018Lo! Gj\u00fakings\u2019 mother grey in counsel, what wife shall Gunnar woo or look for? Fairest must be woman, of fame mightiest, that Gunnar seeketh his gold dealing.\u2019 Gr\u00edmhild \u2018Of the one fairest fame is rumoured: Brynhild the queen bright in splendour. Wide walks the word of her wealth and might; though high nor humble her halls enter.\u2019 Gunnar \u2018Proud and peerless in peril woven, a queen would she be, our courts\u2019 glory! Gunnar Gj\u00faki\u2019s son glory seeking at thy rede shall ride to her realm afar.\u2019 Gr\u00edmhild \u2018The son of Sigmund thy sister holds, Sigurd the mighty is thy sworn brother. At right hand in aid he shall ride with thee; counsels potent shall my cunning find you.\u2019 * Gunnar rode Goti, on Grani Sigurd, H\u00f6gni H\u00f6lkvir, horse night-swarthy. Steeds were striding, stonefire glinting, high wind rushing over helm and mane. Over fell and lowland and forest gloomy, over rocks and rivers their roads led them. Golden gables gleaming saw they; a light was lifted o\u2019er the land afar. Fire forth blossomed, flames up-leaping, trees of lightning twisted branching. Gunnar smote Goti: the ground spurning he reared him backward, nor rowel heeded. Sigurd unsmiling silent waited, in his shrouded heart a shadow deepened: Gunnar \u2018A boon grant me, O blood-brother! Goti will not bear me, now Grani lend me!\u2019 Gunnar smote Grani: on the ground moveless grey-hewn he stood as of graven stone. Gunnar rode not the glittering flame. Oaths swore Sigurd, all fulfilled them. In hope or hate help unfailing, he Gr\u00edmhild\u2019s counsel grim refused not. Counsels potent had her cunning furnished of chill enchantment and changing spell. In Gunnar\u2019s likeness on Grani leaped he; gold spurs glinted, Gram was brandished. The earth shivered; angry roaring fire flaming-tongued flashed heavenward. With sword smitten snorting leaped he, Grani greyfell; the ground trembled. The fire flickered; flame wavered, sank to silence slaked and fading. Swart lay the shadow of Sigurd riding in helm of terror high and looming. Sigurd stood there on sword leaning; Brynhild waited a blade holding. There helm\u00e9d maiden of helm\u00e9d king name demanded: night fell round them. Sigurd \u2018Gunnar Gj\u00faki\u2019s son greets and hails thee. As my queen shalt thou ride my quest fulfilling.\u2019 As on swaying seas a swan glimmering sat she sore troubled seeking counsel: Brynhild \u2018What shall I answer in hour o\u2019ershadowed, Gunnar, Gunnar, with gleaming eyes?\u2019 Brynhild \u2018Gunnar, speak not of golden rings! Swords were me dearer to slay my loves. Art thou all men\u2019s master, all surpassing? \u2013 to only such will I answer give.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Yea, swords hast thou reddened, swords yet shalt wield; and oaths hast thou sworn, and oaths shalt keep. Thy wall is ridden, thy wavering fire: thou art doomed him to wed who dared to pass.\u2019 In a bed them laid Brynhild, Sigurd; a sword them sundered set there naked. Gram lay between gleaming sheathless, fate lay between forged unyielding. Dawn came on earth, day grew round them. From sleeping finger he slipped her ring, and Andvari\u2019s gold, old, enchanted, on Brynhild\u2019s hand bound in token. Sigurd \u2018Wake thou! wake thou! Wide is daylight. I ride to my realm to array the feast.\u2019 * On day appointed dawn rose redly, sun sprang fiery southward hasting. Bridal to Brynhild blissful drank he, Gunnar Gj\u00faki\u2019s son, gold unsparing. All surpassing, proud and ardent, Brynhild sat there, a bride and queen. All men\u2019s master, all surpassing, in came Sigurd as sun rising. By Gudr\u00fan\u2019s side, Gj\u00faki\u2019s daughter, she saw him seated \u2013 a silence fell. As stone graven stared she palely, as cold and still as carven stone. From shrouded heart the shadows parted; oaths were remembered all unfulfilled. As stone carven, stern, unbending, he sat unsmiling no sign making. Clamour rose again, clear the singing. Men were joyful \u2013 mirth they deemed it. In that hall beheld they heroes mightiest, and kings and queens crowned in splendour. * Forth rode Sigurd, the forest seeking, to hunt the hart; horns were sounded. To the Rhine-river, to running water, queens went comely with combs of gold. Their locks they loosened. Long one waded to deeper pools darkly swirling: Gudr\u00fan \u2018More queenly I, more kingly wed! \u2013 fame all surpasses he that F\u00e1fnir slew!\u2019 (Grim laughed Gudr\u00fan Gr\u00edmhild\u2019s daughter:) Andvari\u2019s ring, old, enchanted, is on Brynhild\u2019s hand bound in token. Did Gunnar give me the gleaming ring from thy hand he drew, now here on mine!\u2019 Coldhued as death the queen was stricken, strode swift from stream as stone silent; from Rhine-river, from running water, her bower sought she brooding darkly. Dim fell evening, dusk was starless; her mind was as night as she mourned alone; alone, lightless, made lamentation: Mine own must I have or anguish suffer, or suffer anguish Sigurd losing. Yet he is Gudr\u00fan\u2019s and Gunnar\u2019s I: foul wrought the fates that framed my life!\u2019 Daylong lay she drinking nor eating, as in dead slumber or dreadful thought. Her maidens marvelled \u2013 she minded not, Gunnar sought her; grim she heard him. Then spake Brynhild from bitter pondering: Brynhild \u2018King men call thee! A coward rather, from fire flinching, fearful, quaking! From witch-woman\u2019s womb thou camest. Woe to Gr\u00edmhild, woe\u2019s contriver!\u2019 Gunnar \u2018Vile words to use, thou Valkyrie, thou slayer of men, and sword-hearted!\u2019 Him only loved I who all surpassed; an oath uttered, him only to wed, him only to wed who mine ardent fire vanquished valorous; I am vow-breaker. I am oath-breaker, dishonoured, humbled; I am love-bereaved and life-curs\u00e9d. In thy halls shalt thou hear never happy voices, no queen in thy courts shall comely walk.\u2019 Long there lay she in lamentation; afar heard folk her fell mourning. Gudr\u00fan she spurned, Gunnar scorning, and H\u00f6gni mocking; hate was kindled. * From the hunt rode Sigurd home returning, found halls unlit and hearts darkened. They brought him to seek her for sorrow\u2019s healing; his mood was loath, on the morrow went he. (He draws back the coverlet from Brynhild and wakes her, as before he had done.) Sigurd \u2018Hail, O sunlight and sun\u2019s rising! Sleep no longer and sorrow cast thou!\u2019 Sigurd \u2018What grief ails thee amid good liking, who to glorious Gunnar wert gladly wed?\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Yet glory no less hath Gj\u00faki\u2019s son, my blood-brother, best renown\u00e9d. Well he loves thee, lord unfearing \u2013 look now and learn light yet shineth!\u2019 Brynhild \u2018Nay, F\u00e1fnir Sigurd fearless conquered; my wavering fire he waded twice; twice he waded tongues of lightning: so great glory never Gunnar earned.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018That twice he waded, who told thee so? Sigurd hath not said it \u2013 why saist thou this?\u2019 Veils of darkness they vanquished me. I am life-curs\u00e9d and love-bereaved. Yet I curse thee too, cruel forswearer, who rendered to another the ring taken. Gudr\u00fan I curse for cruel reproach of bed broken and body yielded. Thy glory alone seems good to thee; of all women the worst thou weenest me.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Woe worth the words by women spoken! Woe worth the while this work began! Webs enwound me woven dreadly, my mind shadowing, my mood darkening. Long I loved thee, long desiring. Thee only would I hold, now all I know. My mood mastering, my mind wielding, I sat unsmiling, no sign making. This solace sought I, that I saw thee still, the one hall walking though wife of other.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Is hope all fallen, is healing vain? Must fate fierce-hearted thus find its end?\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Swords lightly sleep, soon may I feel them! Then would Brynhild die \u2013 bitter would she deem it.\u2019 Sigurd \u2018Yet Gunnar would I slay, Gudr\u00fan forsake, from death thee to keep, our doom o\u2019ercoming!\u2019 * Forth went Sigurd filled with anguish, his heart was swollen in heaving breast. Mail-rings clutched him, marred his breathing, to his flesh cutting fiercely straining. There stood Gudr\u00fan gleaming-lovely: Gudr\u00fan wanly grasped him weeping: (Then spake Gunnar gloomy-hearted:) Then Gunnar offered gold and silver, gold and silver gleaming-hoarded. All men\u2019s master, all surpassing, such only ever shall earn my love. Than thy liege lower thou art less become, a V\u00f6lsung\u2019s squire, a vassal\u2019s servant! From thy bed parting, at thy board humbled I will leave thee alone to laughter of men, if life thou allowest to liege forsworn, if thou slay not Sigurd, thy sister\u2019s lord.\u2019 Gunnar \u2018Fell-hearted thou, and foe of peace! I oaths have sworn for ever lasting, bonds of brotherhood in blood mingled; though Brynhild bid it, I may break them not.\u2019 Brynhild \u2018Oaths too I swore for ever lasting \u2013 light thou heldest them! I am love-betrayed. Sigurd thou sent me, thy sworn brother. My bed he entered, by my body laid him, betrayed thy trust, betraying me. To Gudr\u00fan he told it, Gudr\u00fan knoweth. In shame am I shrouded, and shamed art thou!\u2019 Gunnar came forth grievous-hearted, daylong he sat, deeply brooding. From mood to mood his mind wandered, from shame to shame shorn of friendship. H\u00f6gni called he to hidden counsel, his true brother, whom he trusted well. Gunnar \u2018Evil wrought Sigurd: oaths he swore me, oaths he swore me, all belied them; betrayed my trust, whom I trusted most, truth forswearing, whom most true I deemed.\u2019 H\u00f6gni \u2018Brynhild beguiles thee baleful-hearted, woe devising to woe stings thee; loathing Gudr\u00fan, her love grudging, thy love loathing, she lies to thee.\u2019 Gunnar \u2018Brynhild, Brynhild, I better hold her than all women, than all treasure. I will life sooner leave than lose her now, than live lonely for laughter of men. Let us slay Sigurd \u2013 forsworn is he! Let us lords be alone of our lands again! Let us slay Sigurd, this sorrow ending, and masters make us of his mighty hoard!\u2019 H\u00f6gni \u2018Woe worth the words by women spoken! Lords unassailed our league made us. The might of Sigurd we shall mourn later, and the sister-sons this sire had got us.\u2019 To Gotthorm turning, Gr\u00edmhild\u2019s offspring, greyhearted lord, Gunnar hailed him: Gold he promised him and great lordship; his bastard blood burned with hunger. Snake\u2019s flesh they took, seethed it darkly, wolf-meat gave him, wine enchanted. Drunk with madness, dire and wolvish, he grinned and gnashed his grinding teeth. Of guile unworthy, no guile dreaming, yet doom foreboding, drear went Sigurd. To the forest fared he, falcon loosing, with hounds hunting, for harm\u2019s solace. Gotthorm rode there, and Grani marked he, assailing Sigurd, with searing words. Gotthorm \u2018O werewolf\u2019s son and war-captive, what huntest here where hart roameth \u2013 thou wooer of women and wife-marrer, who wouldst lord all alone our lands and queens!\u2019 Sword touched Sigurd swart-red flushing; white blanched the knuckles on hilt clenching: Gotthorm he left to grind his teeth; back rode Sigurd foreboding ill. Night fell starless, none were waking; asleep was Gudr\u00fan by Sigurd dreaming. Dawn came wanly: drunk with hatred there Gotthorm stalked as glowering wolf. Sword leaped naked, sleeping stabbed him, pierced through to pillow, pinned in anguish. Forth sprang the wolf by fear blinded of awful eyes that opened wide. Gram was brandished, gleaming handled, hissing hurled aloft at hasting beast. At the door he tumbled dreadly crying; there hell took him hewn asunder. Forth crashed the head, feet fell backward; blood ran darkly on bower threshold. In sweet embrace to sleep she went, to grief unending Gudr\u00fan wakened, to her bliss drowning in blood flowing. in flowing blood of fairest lord. Breast white and bare she beat so sore that Sigurd raised him from soaking pillow: Brynhild wrought this: best she loved me, worst she dealt me, worst belied me. I Gunnar never grieved nor injured; oaths I swore him, all fulfilled them!\u2019 Dead fell Sigurd; dreadly Gudr\u00fan cried in anguish, called him vainly. Swords rang on wall, and sleepers shivered; geese screamed shrill in green meadow. Then laughed Brynhild in her bed listening with whole heart once \u2013 the house shuddered \u2013 Gudr\u00fan hearing in grief\u2019s torment. Gunnar answered grimly speaking: Gunnar \u2018Little thou laughest for delight of soul, O fell-hearted! Fey I deem thee. Thy colour blancheth, cold thy cheeks are; cold thy counsels and accursed thy redes.\u2019 Brynhild \u2018Cursed are the Niflungs, cruel forswearers. Oaths swore Sigurd, all fulfilled them. Ye all shall find evil fortune, while all men\u2019s honour he for ever holdeth. Bonds of brotherhood in blood mingled with murder kept ye; he remembered them. A sword lay naked set between us, Gram lay grimly gleaming sheathless. Now life no longer will I live with you; of love ye robbed me with lying counsels. Shorn I leave you, shame enduring, of faith and friendship, of fame on earth.\u2019 In arms he took her, anguished begged her her hand to stay, hope to look for. She thrust them from her who thronged round her, longing only for her last journey. (H\u00f6gni only withheld her not:) * Gold corslet she took, gleaming hauberk, helm set on head, in hand a sword. On the sword she cast her, sank down wounded: thus Brynhild ended her bright splendour. Brynhild \u2018A boon I beg thee, this boon at last! Pile high a pyre on the plain builded; shields hang round it and shining cloths, blood pour over it for us brightly shed! A hawk at each hand, a hound at feet, there harnessed set ye our horses slain. At his side lay me, sword between us, naked gleaming as on night of yore. Burn there Brynhild in the blazing fire who in flames awoke to fell sorrow. In flames send forth that fairest lord now as sun setting who as sun did rise!\u2019 Flames were kindled, fume was swirling, a roaring fire ringed with weeping. Thus Sigurd passed, seed of V\u00f6lsung, there Brynhild burned: bliss was ended. * On the hell-way hastened the helm\u00e9d queen, never born again from bleak regions. In Valh\u00f6llu V\u00f6lsungs feasted: \u2018Son\u2019s son welcome, seed of \u00d3din!\u2019 Thus soon came Sigurd the sword bearing to glad Valh\u00f6ll greeting \u00d3din. There feasts he long at his father\u2019s side, for War waiting, the World\u2019s chosen. When Heimdall\u2019s horn is heard ringing and the Blazing Bridge bends neath horsemen, Brynhild shall arm him with belt and sword, a beaker bear him brimmed with glory. In the day of Doom he shall deathless stand who death tasted and dies no more, the serpent-slayer, seed of \u00d3din: not all shall end, nor Earth perish. On his head the Helm, in his hand lightning, afire his spirit, in his face splendour. When war passeth in world rebuilt, bliss shall they drink who the bitter tasted. Thus passed Sigurd, seed of V\u00f6lsung, hero mightiest, hope of \u00d3din. But woe of Gudr\u00fan through this world lasteth, to the end of days all shall hear her. *",

When Sigmund and Sinfj\u00f6tli had at last been captured Siggeir had a great burial-mound made of stones and turf; and in the midst of the mound there was set a huge stone slab so that when they were put into it they were separated and could not pass the slab, but could hear each other.

Nowhere else in Norse is Gunnar recognised as a Burgundian, nor is the word found as the name of a people; but very remarkably the same expression is found in one of the fragments of the Old English poem Waldere, where Gu\u00f0here is called wine Burgenda.

In the Saga she began, when at last prevailed upon by Gunnar to speak, by asking him: \u2018What have you done with the ring I gave you, which king Budli gave me at our last parting, when you Gj\u00fakings came to him and vowed to harry and burn unless you gained me?\u2019 Then she said that Budli had given her two choices, to wed as he wished, or to lose all her wealth and his favour; and seeing that she could not strive with him she promised to wed the one who would ride through her fire on the horse Grani with F\u00e1fnir\u2019s hoard. This further confusion arising from the \u2018doubled\u2019 view of Brynhild is once again eliminated in the Lay, as are other details of the story in the Saga: the fettering of Brynhild by H\u00f6gni after her threat to kill Gunnar, and her tearing of her tapestry apart.",

            "TEXT": "Their bliss was over, their bale ended; but Gudr\u00fan\u2019s grief ever grew the more. Life she hated, but life took not, witless wandering in woods alone. * Atli ariseth armies wielding; on the marches of the East his might waxeth. Goths he tramples, gold despoiling, his horsemen countless hasten westward. He, Budli\u2019s son, blades remembers that of Budli\u2019s brother were the bane of old; he, gold-greedy, grimhearted king, hath heard of the hoard on the Heath that lay. Of F\u00e1fnir\u2019s treasure fame was rumoured, that Niflungs held in Niflung-land; of Gudr\u00fan\u2019s beauty gleaming-lovely; of Gj\u00faki aged to his grave passing. * From mighty Mirkwood came message darkly: \u2018Atli ariseth armies mustering. Hate awakens, hosts are arming; under horses\u2019 hooves Hunland trembles!\u2019 Gunnar spake then gloomy-hearted: Then spake H\u00f6gni, haughty chieftain: Then spake Gr\u00edmhild grey with wisdom: Gudr\u00fan they sought, grieving found her in woodland house weaving lonely; weaving wondrous webs bright-figured with woe tangled and with works of old. * \u00d3din she wrought old, blue-mantled; Loki lightfooted with locks of flame; the falls of Andvari framed of silver, the gold of Andvari she gleaming wove. The house of V\u00f6lsung huge was timbered, the Tree there tossed tangled branches. There Gr\u00edmnir\u2019s gift gleaming brandished Sigmund standing stern unbending. The hall of Siggeir high was burning fire-encircled flame-devour\u00e9d. Sign\u00fd stood there Sigmund greeting, fire about her, flame behind her. Shields of silver had the ship of Sigmund; wild the waves were, wind them twisted. Sailed there slowly Sinfj\u00f6tli\u2019s bier through stormy seas steered by \u00d3din. There Regin wrought by the red embers; there Gram was hammered amid gleaming sparks. High loomed the head of helm\u00e9d dragon; under black belly there was blink of gold. Long lay the shadow of lone rider golden-harnessed Gram brandishing; sun-bright Sigurd seed of V\u00f6lsung, on Grani riding into Gj\u00faki\u2019s courts. * Golden weregild Gunnar brought her, haughty H\u00f6gni humbly bent him. Gudr\u00fan they hailed, Gunnar and H\u00f6gni; head she turned not, hate still burned her. In came Gr\u00edmhild guileful-hearted: Gudr\u00fan lifted her grieving eyes, dimmed with weeping, dark with mourning. Dark with wisdom, deep with purpose were Gr\u00edmhild\u2019s eyes gazing through her. Gr\u00edmhild \u2018Atli ariseth, armies wieldeth, king of Eastland\u2019s countless peoples. His queen shall rule courts of splendour, over all women else on earth upraised.\u2019 Gudr\u00fan \u2018Of gold were the days, gold and silver, silver and golden, ere Sigurd came. A maid among maids in mirth walked I; only dreams and shadows, only dreams vexed me. A hart I dreamed high and golden: now is sped the shaft and spilled the blood. A wolf thou gavest me for woe\u2019s comfort, in my brethren\u2019s blood he bathed me red. I love them little, I believe them not, but my brethren\u2019s blood is no boot for me. How shall husband heal me of harm I bear in hateful Hunland who am hopeless now?\u2019 Gr\u00edmhild \u2018Thy brothers blame not! Brynhild wrought it, thy wrong and sorrow \u2013 it rues them sore. And dreams are but dreams, or else doom foretell; yet doom must be dreed, though dreams foreshow. Hungold is bright, Hunland is wide, Atli mightiest of earthly kings. And gold is healing, though grieve the heart; a queen\u2019s bed better than one cold and bare!\u2019 Gudr\u00fan \u2018Why drivest me on with daunting eyes dire of purpose, doom forestalling? To Sigurd thou gavest me, to sorrow it turned; now leave me to rest, leave thy daughter!\u2019 Gr\u00edmhild \u2018No rest for the living, no room for tears, who with pride and purpose oppose their fate! No rest I grant thee! My redes hearken, or rue for ever thou wert wrought on earth!\u2019 Dark hung her eyes daunting Gudr\u00fan, deep and dreadful, dire with purpose. For no word she waited, wisdom knew she; forth went Gr\u00edmhild from Gudr\u00fan\u2019s side. * Of Gudr\u00fan\u2019s beauty glad was Atli; of gold he dreamed him guarded darkly; of the serpent\u2019s hoard that Sigurd left her, of the wife of Sigurd of women fairest. Bridal drank he blissful-hearted to Gudr\u00fan pale in gleaming robes. Oaths he swore them, to each her brothers, and lasting truce, league of kinship. Dark and splendid, dreadly builded, and echoing vast were Atli\u2019s halls. Kings sat neath him, countless chieftains, and Hunnish horsemen harnessed grimly. High sat Gudr\u00fan Hunland\u2019s mistress, cold lay Gudr\u00fan queen of Hunland. Her lord loved her, lovely was she; laughter she knew not, yet her limbs were white. But longer him lasted his lust of gold, the gold he dreamed him guarded darkly. The serpent\u2019s treasure they sent it never, the Niflungs kept it in Niflung-land. Long he pondered, till lust swayed him; woes were wakened and wars of old. Long nights lying he looked on her; dark nights drowsing he dreamed of gold. Oaths he had uttered, evil he pondered; but his heart\u2019s purpose was hidden under. Yet words he muttered in wandering sleep; Gudr\u00fan guessed them, gloom foreboding. A feast he fashioned, far proclaimed it; to high-builded halls his hosts were bidden; all kith and kindred called to greet him, to dealing of rings, drink and laughter. * On valiant horse Vingi swiftly, herald of Hunland, hasted westward. To Gunnar came he, Gj\u00faking mighty, to halls of Rhineland high and golden. There drank they deep; dark they eyed him, Hun-speech hearing in their hall ringing. Cold fell his cry calling loudly under helm standing hailing Gunnar. Vingi \u2018Atli hath sent me on errand speedy, on horse hasting through hoar forest. Gunnar he greeteth, Gunnar and H\u00f6gni. Be blithe he bids you, to his boon hearken! A feast he fashions, fair he dights it, all kith and kindred calls to meet him. Rings will he deal, raiment costly, saddles silverlaid, and southern purple. Shields shall ye choose there and shirts of mail, spears smooth-shafted and splendid helms. Gifts will he give you, graven silver, gold-hilted swords, and goodly lands.\u2019 His head bowed Gunnar to H\u00f6gni speaking: Is there sword in the East that my sword matcheth? Are there helms in Hunland so high as ours? Are we lieges of Atli, lands receiving from Hun master? H\u00f6gni answer!\u2019 H\u00f6gni \u2018Of Gudr\u00fan I think \u2013 grim thoughts awake! A ring she hath sent me, a ring only. Wolf\u2019s hair winds it, woven round it, wolves lie in wait at the way\u2019s ending.\u2019 Gunnar \u2018Yet runes she sends me, runes of healing, words well-graven on wood to read; fast bids us fare to feast gladly, old woes forgetting and ancient wrong.\u2019 * Gifts gave Gunnar, guerdon kingly; wine bade men bring to weary guest. Deep there drank they to day\u2019s ending, doom they recked not; din resounded. In came Gr\u00edmhild grey with wisdom, the runes she read, the written tokens. Her brows darkened boding evil; to Gunnar spake she grave and slowly. Gr\u00edmhild \u2018These runes I doubt: they are writ with cunning, strangely twisted, stained and darkened. There were others under, now overlaid \u2013 if I read them right they were runes of ill.\u2019 Gunnar had drunken, to his guest turned he: Laughing said Vingi: I must haste away, so will hide it not, that Atli is old, but Erp is young. Thy sister\u2019s son is but seven winters \u2013 strong hands he needs to steer his realm. In Gunnar hoped he for guide and help, of his sister\u2019s son the safe keeper. He weened ye might wield his wide kingdom \u2013 ye are fallen afraid, and fear shadows.\u2019 H\u00f6gni him answered hard and scornful: Yet Atli I heard not too old for guile, war to ponder, or wealth to covet. And fey saith my thought: \u201cFar lies the day ere Erp or Eitill after Atli rule!\u201d\u2019 But loud cried Gunnar laughing scornful, deep had he drunken darkly musing: Winds shall wander where wine we drank, but Gunnar will go Gudr\u00fan seeking. We fast shall follow thy feet, Vingi! Our horns shall be heard Hunland rousing.\u2019 (From heavy heart then H\u00f6gni answered:) Then vowed Vingi the venom-tongu\u00e9d \u2013 oaths he recked not, the oft forsworn: * Niflungs rode forth from Niflung-land; fast their journey, few went with them. Gr\u00edmhild stood there grey and aged, dark eyes were dimmed death foreseeing. Their word was spoken, wills were hardened; fate drove them on, fey they parted. None might hinder near them thronging, lords nor wisemen; with a laugh they rode. Steeds went striding, stonefire glinted, rocks were ringing, roads resounding. In hoar forests harts were startled, over hill and valley hooves were beating. Over river rowed they roaring onward; oars were bending urged to breaking. Foam flew from prow, flashed and sparkled; at bank unbound the boats left they. In the hoar forest horns they sounded Hunland rousing; hooves were beating. Golden harness gleamed and sparkled; steeds came striding stung to madness. * From hill upon high halls they looked on, walls and watchtowers wondrous-builded. They were forest-girdled, fenced with spearmen; horses neighed there, helms were glinting. There was clamour in the courts, cold rang the steel; shafts were shaken, shields them answered. Gates found they barred, grim doors of iron: H\u00f6gni smote them, hewed them fiercely. (Forth came Vingi the venom-tongu\u00e9d:) H\u00f6gni \u2018Heralds were holy \u2013 but unhallowed liar, thou shalt hang the first, and hell take thee!\u2019 From the oak-branches with arms corded they hung him high in the Huns\u2019 faces. Huns loud clamoured, hate was kindled; forth rushed they fell, fierce the onslaught. In battle blended Budlungs, Niflungs; blades were brandished, burst were helmets. Back they beat them broken-harnessed; to the doors they drove them \u2013 din was in the gates. In leaped H\u00f6gni, held the gateway, hewed two-handed, hurled them backward. The few and fearless as a fire entered, as roaring flame, wrath devouring. Wolves sprang behind, the ways were reddened, the walls echoed, wailing filled them. Steep, stone-builded, the stair arose to dark doorways dreadly timbered. There H\u00f6gni halted, hailed them loudly: Out came Atli, anger-clouded: That gold give me that is Gudr\u00fan\u2019s right, that Sigurd conquered, the serpent\u2019s treasure!\u2019 H\u00f6gni laughed then, on his hilts leaning; Gunnar glowering grimly answered. Gunnar \u2018No gold from Gunnar shalt thou get for ever! Life canst thou take at latest end. Dear wilt thou buy it in dread barter of lords and lieges, lives uncounted!\u2019 Atli \u2018Fools the Niflungs, feud-forgetful; foul-stained their hands with friend-murder. Gudr\u00fan\u2019s husband for Gudr\u00fan\u2019s wrong a grim vengeance will gladly wreak.\u2019 Gunnar \u2018Here Gudr\u00fan spake not! Golden weregild she looks nor longs for \u2013 the lust is thine!\u2019 Horns they sounded \u2013 hall-walls echoed \u2013 strode the stairway; stern their onslaught. The stones they stained with streaming blood; snaketongu\u00e9d arrows sang about them. Doors clanged backward, din resounded: Hunland\u2019s champions hurled upon them. Hard were handstrokes, hewn were corslets, as on hundred anvils were hammers ringing. * In hall sat Gudr\u00fan at heart weary, from mood to mood her mind wavered. The din she hearkened, deadly crying, as back were beaten the Borgund-lords. Gudr\u00fan \u2018Little I love them, long I hated! A wolf they gave me for woe\u2019s comfort. Yet the wolf rends them, and woe is me! Woe worth the hour that of womb I came!\u2019 Her hands she wrung on high standing, loud called she clear to lieges there: Who would love requite, who would lies disown, who remember misery by these masters wrought, arm now! arm now! aid the fearless betrayed and trapped by this troll-people!\u2019 Atli sat there, anger burned him; yet murmurs mounted, men were rising. Goths were there many: griefs they remembered, wars in Mirkwood and wars of old. From the hall striding high they shouted, foes turned to friends fiercely greeted: \u2018Goths and Niflungs our gods helping will hew the Huns to hell\u2019s shadow!\u2019 The few and fearless fiercely answered (their backs were driven to the builded walls): Of the Goths\u2019 glory Gunnar sang there; of Iormunrek earth-shadowing king; of Angant\u00fdr and old battles, of Dylgja, D\u00fanhei\u00f0, and Danpar\u2019s walls. Forth went H\u00f6gni, hate rekindled, his son Sn\u00e6var at his side leaping. Hewn was H\u00f6gni by a Hun chieftain; his shield was shorn in shards falling. Sn\u00e6var they slew there, their swords stabbed him; he left his life laughing grimly. H\u00f6gni wept not; from his hand the shield stooping lifted; strode then onward. The stairs they strode streaming redly; at dark doorways they dinned and hammered; into halls of Atli hewed a pathway; rushed in roaring, reeking-handed. Gudr\u00fan they greeted, Gunnar and H\u00f6gni: Gudr\u00fan \u2018If for wrongs ye wrought ruth now moves you, doom forestall not! This deed forego!\u2019 Forth went Atli, anguish gnawed him; to Gudr\u00fan H\u00f6gni said grim farewell: * Forth sent Atli his errand-riders; Hunland hearkened, hosts were arming. Gallowsfowl to gladden Goths and Niflungs from the hall they hurled the Hunnish corpses. Daylight grew dim, dark shadows walked in echoing halls that Atli loved. In need most dire the Niflung lords doom awaited; the doors were shut. Night lapped the world and noiseless town; under ashen moonlight the owls hooted. At guarded doorways Gunnar and H\u00f6gni silent sat they sleepless waiting. First spake H\u00f6gni: Gunnar answered: There is tramp of men torches bearing, clink of corslet, clank of armour. There is crying of ravens, cold howls the wolf, shields are shimmering, shafts uplifted.\u2019 Gunnar & H\u00f6gni \u2018Wake now, wake now! War is kindled. Now helm to head, to hand the sword. Wake now, warriors, wielding glory! To wide Valh\u00f6ll ways lie open.\u2019 * At the dark doorways they dinned and hammered; there was clang of swords and crash of axes. The smiths of battle smote the anvils; sparked and splintered spears and helmets. In they hacked them, out they hurled them, bears assailing, boars defending. Stones and stairways streamed and darkened; day came dimly \u2013 the doors were held. Five days they fought few and dauntless; the doors were riven, dashed asunder. They barred them with bodies, bulwarks piling of Huns and Niflungs hewn and cloven. (Atli spoke then anguish mourning:) Woe and wailing in my wide kingdom! Where I feasted long are fell serpents. The proud pillars are purple-stained in the builded halls that Budli reared.\u2019 Then Beiti spake there bale devising, the king\u2019s counsellor \u2013 he was cunning-hearted: Fire still may tame these fell serpents, thy pillars be the pyre of these proud robbers!\u2019 For the ruin and wrack wrath seized Atli; that shame he shirked not, shorn of glory. Flame-encircled fearless Niflungs in riven harness redly glinted. Iron-bolted walls, ancient timbers, creaked and smouldered, cracked and tumbled. There hot and smoking fell hissing embers, and plashed and sputtered in the pools of gore. Reek was round them, a rolling smoke; dank dripped their sweat \u2013 the doors were held. Their shields they raised over shattered helmets; they stamped the brands on streaming floors. Blacktongued with thirst blood there drank they; fell one by one on the ways to hell. Out burst the brethren blackhued, grisly, boars bleeding-tusked at bay at last. The Huns grasped them helmless, shieldless, bare and bleeding, with broken swords. As hounds affrighted Huns were crying; they were rent and riven by reeking hands. Necks were broken and knees sundered, ere the Borgund king was bound and thrown. Last fought H\u00f6gni alone hopeless; his teeth tore them as they tied him down. The dust was bitten, the doom fallen, the Need of the Niflungs and their night was come. In dank prison dark and evil H\u00f6gni hurled they; Huns him guarded. But Gunnar bound in Gudr\u00fan\u2019s bower was flung at the feet of her frenzied lord. Atli \u2018Too long have I looked for this last meeting, Budlung\u2019s vengeance on Borgund lord. Here lies at last in lowly dust lordly Gunnar! Gudr\u00fan behold! Sigurd remember, and say me now, is it sweet to see him so sore avenged? In my serpent-pit snakes are waiting \u2013 they bite more bitter than blades of steel!\u2019 Gunnar he trampled, Gudr\u00fan saw him: Atli \u2018Let them give me the gold, the gleaming hoard, the serpent\u2019s treasure that Sigurd conquered! The gold, the gold that grieves my dreams \u2013 if Gunnar will grant it, I will grant him thee!\u2019 Gunnar \u2018I will give thee the gold, goodly portion, the half yielding which I hold my own. Half hath H\u00f6gni, my haughty brother; to his latest breath he will loose it not. Let heart of H\u00f6gni at my hand be laid from breast bleeding with blades severed; then gold will I give, gold of serpents \u2013 all shall Atli eager take it!\u2019 Gudr\u00fan \u2018Yet H\u00f6gni no less, mine hapless brother, I did beg from thee by those born of us!\u2019 Out went Atli, evil he purposed; but wisemen bade him wary counsel. The queen fearing of cunning thought they; a thrall they seized and thrust in prison. * Hjalli the thrall \u2018Woe worth the wiles and wars of kings, if my life I must lose in their luckless feud! The light of morning, labour daylong, fire at evening, too few my days!\u2019 Huns \u2018Hjalli, swineherd, thy heart give us!\u2019 Shrilly shrieked he at the shining knife. They bared his breast, and bitter wailed he; ere the point pricked him he piercing cried. H\u00f6gni heard him, to the Huns spake he: The heart then cut they from Hjalli\u2019s bosom; to Gunnar bore it on golden dish: Gunnar \u2018I hapless see here heart of craven. H\u00f6gni hath not heart that trembles. Quivering lies it; quaked it swifter beating in baseborn breast ignoble.\u2019 Loudly laughed he at life\u2019s ending, when knife was come to Niflung lord. The heart they cut from H\u00f6gni\u2019s bosom; to Gunnar bore it on golden dish. Gunnar \u2018I haughty see here heart undaunted. H\u00f6gni held it, heart untrembling. Unshaken lies it, so shook it seldom beating in boldest breast of princes. Alone now living, Lord of Niflungs, the gold I hold and guard for ever! In hall nor heath nor hidden dungeon shall friend or foeman find it gleaming. Rhine shall rule it, rings and goblets, in weltering water wanly shining. In the deeps we cast it; dark it rolleth, as useless to man as of yore it proved! Cursed be Atli, king of evil, of glory naked, gold-bereav\u00e9d; gold-bereav\u00e9d, gold-tormented, murder-tainted, murder-haunted!\u2019 Fires of madness flamed and started from eyes of Atli; anguish gnawed him: * There gleaming-eyed Gudr\u00fan waited; the heart within her hardened darkly. Grim mood took her, Gr\u00edmhild\u2019s daughter, ruthless hatred, wrath consuming. There grimly waited Gunnar naked; snakes were creeping silent round him. Teeth were poisoned, tongues were darting; in lidless eyes light was shining. A harp she sent him; his hands seized it, strong he smote it; strings were ringing. Wondering heard men words of triumph, song up-soaring from the serpents\u2019 pit. There coldly creeping coiling serpents as stones were staring stilled, enchanted. There slowly swayed they, slumber whelmed them, as Gunnar sang of Gunnar\u2019s pride. As voice in Valh\u00f6ll valiant ringing the golden Gods he glorious named; of \u00d3din sang he, \u00d3din\u2019s chosen, of Earth\u2019s most mighty, of ancient kings. A huge adder hideous gleaming from stony hiding was stealing slow. Huns still heard him his harp thrilling, and doom of Hunland dreadly chanting. An ancient adder evil-swollen, to breast it bent and bitter stung him. Loud cried Gunnar life forsaking; harp fell silent, and heart was still. To the queen that cry came clear and piercing; aghast she sat in guarded bower. Erp and Eitill eager called she: dark their locks were, dark their glances. * Pyres they builded proud and stately; Hunland\u2019s champions there high upraised. A pyre they builded on the plain standing; there naked lay the Niflung lords. Flames were mounting, fire was roaring, reek was swirling ringed with tumult. Smoke was fading, sunk was burning; windblown ashes were wafted cold. A hall was thronging, Huns were drinking the funeral feast of fallen men. Foes were vanquished, fire had burned them; now Atli was lord of East and West. Wealth he dealt there, wounds requiting, worthy weregild of warriors slain. Loud they praised him; long the drinking, wild grew the words of the wine-bemused. Gudr\u00fan came forth goblets bearing: Gudr\u00fan \u2018Hail, O Hun-king, hear me speaking: My brethren are slain that I begged of thee. Erp and Eitill dost thou ask to look on? Ask no longer \u2013 their end hath come! Their hearts thou tastest with honey mingled, their blood was blent in the bowls I gave; those bowls their skulls bound with silver, their bones thy hounds have burst with teeth.\u2019 There awful cries of anguish woke; their heads men hid their horror shrouding. Pale grew Atli, as one poison-sick, on his face crashed he fallen swooning. To bed they brought him in bower empty, laid him and left him to loathsome dream. Women were wailing, wolves were howling, hounds were baying the horn\u00e9d moon. In came Gudr\u00fan with ghastly eyes, darkly mantled, dire of purpose. Atli \u2018Gr\u00edmhild\u2019s daughter ghastly-handed, hounds should tear thee and to hell send thee! Stoned and branded at the stake living thou shouldst burn and wither thou born of witch!\u2019 Gudr\u00fan mocked him, gasping left him. Fires she kindled, flames she brandished; the house was roaring, hounds were yelping. Timbers crumbled, trees and rafters; there sank and died slaves and maidens. Smoke was swirling over sleeping town, light was lifted over land and tree. Women were weeping, wolves were yammering, hounds were howling in the Hun-kingdom. Thus Atli ended earth forsaking, to the Niflungs\u2019 bane the night was come; of V\u00f6lsung, Niflung, of vows broken, of woe and valour are the words ended. * While world lasteth shall the words linger, while men are mindful of the mighty days. The woe of Gudr\u00fan while world lasteth till end of days all shall hearken. Her mind wavered, her mood grew cold; her heart withered and hate sickened. Life she hated, yet life took not, witless wandering in the woods alone. Over wan rivers, over woods and forests, over rocks she roamed to the roaring sea. In the waves she cast her, the waves spurned her; by the waves sitting she woe bemoaned. Gudr\u00fan \u2018Of gold were the days, gleaming silver, silver gleaming ere Sigurd came. A maid was I then, a maiden fair; only dreams vexed me, dreams of evil. Fell sorrows five hath fate sent me: they slew Sigurd, my sorrow greatest. In evil loathing to Atli me gave: too long lasting my life\u2019s disease. The heart of H\u00f6gni they hewed living: my heart it hardened, my hardest woe. Gunnar heard I in the grave crying: my grief most grim was that ghastly voice. My sons I slew seared with madness: keen it bites me most clinging woe. There sits beside me son nor daughter; the world is empty, the waves are cold. They slew Sigurd: my sorrow deepest, my life\u2019s loathing, my life\u2019s disease. Sigurd, Sigurd, on swift Grani lay saddle and bridle and seek for me! Rememberest thou what on marriage-bed in love we pledged, as we laid us down? \u2013 the light I would leave to look for thee, from hell thou wouldst ride and haste to me!\u2019 In the waves she cast her, the waves took her; in the wan water her woe was drowned. While the world lasteth woe of Gudr\u00fan till the end of days all shall hearken. * Thus glory endeth, and gold fadeth, on noise and clamours the night falleth. Lift up your hearts, lords and maidens for the song of sorrow that was sung of old.",

The vast dominion of Ermanaric extended over many tribes and peoples from the Black Sea north towards the Baltic; but about the year 375, in his old age, he took his own life, in the face of the first overwhelming onset of the Asiatic steppe nomads, the Huns, who inspired widespread terror by their savagery and their appearance. To that distant time the song of Gunnar reached back, as did his minstrelsy at the feast held in honour of Sigurd in the halls of Gj\u00faki (the Lay of the V\u00f6lsungs, VII.14); the line \u2018earth-shadowing king\u2019 in the present stanza no doubt refers to the vastness of Ermanaric\u2019s empire.",

Attila received the Roman embassy in the village of wooden buildings that was his headquarters, standing in the midst of a vast plain without stone or tree; and Priscus not only narrowly observed the banquet at which Attila presided, and much else, but described it in such sharp detail as to suggest that he took notes at the time of all that he saw. In this unique account of a barbarian banquet in the Heroic Age Priscus described the elaborate and interminable ceremony in which Attila drank to the health of each guest in turn, and the fine feast served on looted silver dishes with looted drinking-cups of silver and gold \u2013 in contrast to the unadorned simplicity of Attila, who drank from a wooden cup and ate only meat, on a wooden plate. He described the entertainment provided: there were singers who chanted songs in praise of the great deeds of Attila; there was a madman, and a buffooning dwarf, who aroused loud laughter, but not from Attila, who sat through all this in grim and rigid silence. But when his youngest son Ernac entered the hall Priscus saw that Attila looked at him \u2018with softened gaze\u2019 and stroked his face. He asked a Hun who sat beside him for an explanation of this, and he replied that the soothsayers had told Attila that the fortunes of his family would fail, but would be restored to greatness by this son.

In his empire, and so also in his armies, were many East Germanic peoples; and now in his host came the Ostrogoths under their king Valamer, the Gepids under Ardaric, Rugians, Thuringians, and warriors of other nations beside. Against them came in uneasy alliance the Visigoths (the western Goths) of Tolosa (Toulouse) under their aged king Theodoric, Aetius the Roman general, Burgundians from their new lands in Savoy, Franks, even a contingent of Saxons.

Among Latin-speaking peoples he was taken up into what has been called \u2018ecclesiastical mythology\u2019, and became Flagellum Dei, the Scourge of God, divinely appointed to the devastation of a wicked world. In the lands of Germania there were two radically distinct traditions concerning him: he appears in a double light, generous patron and monstrous foe, and it is not difficult to see how this should have come about. On the Catalaunian plains there was a colossal conflict between men of many Germanic nations. As I have said, in the hosts of Attila went men of many East Germanic peoples subject to the Huns, most notably the Ostrogoths, and for them Attila was the great King and overlord, to whom their own kings paid allegiance: indeed his very name Attila looks like a diminutive form of the Gothic word atta, \u2018father\u2019. In South German (High German) tradition Attila, his name changed in the course of time through phonetic movement to Etzel, is a benevolent monarch, hospitable and ineffectual, far removed from the Attila of history.",

For reasons that are not clearly explained Siegfried came into conflict with \u2018the bold Nibelungs\u2019, the two princes named Nibelung and Schilbung, and slew them, and their friends. He fought also with a dwarf named Alberich, and subdued him, but did not kill him: he had the hoard taken back into the cavern whence it had come, and made Alberich the guardian of the treasure. He was now the lord of \u2018Nibelungeland\u2019, the possessor of the great hoard, and for the rest of the first part of the Nibelungenlied he has the support of warriors from Nibelungeland, who are called Nibelungs. But in the second part of the German poem, which is held to rest on a quite different poetic source, the name \u2018Nibelungs\u2019 is applied, very strangely and on a first reading of the poem most disturbingly, in a totally different sense: it now means the Burgundians, just as it does in Norse.",

The Light Elves dwell in a glorious place called \u00c1lfheimr (Elf-home, Elf-world), but the Dark Elves \u2018live down in the earth, and they are unlike the Light Elves in appearance, but much more unlike in nature.

Then Surtur from the South shall fare and tree-devouring fire shall bear that bright as sun on swords shall shine in battle of the hosts divine; the hills of stone shall bend their head; all men the paths of death shall tread. Then darkened shall the sunlight be, and Earth shall founder under sea, and from the cloven heavens all the gleaming stars shall flee and fall; the steam shall rise in roaring spires and heaven\u2019s roof be licked with fires. * A house there is that sees no sun, dark-builded on the beaches dun where cold waves wash the Deadly Shore, and northward looks its shadowy door; the louver poisoned rain lets fall, of woven serpents in the wall. Laden in heavy streams there wade men perjured, men who have betrayed the trust of friend; and there the coward and wolvish murderer is devoured: the dragon who yet Yggdrasil gnaws at the roots there takes his fill. Dim-flying shall that dragon haste over the beaches dark and waste, up from the Nether-fells shall spring bearing those corpses under wing, then plunge, and sea close o\u2019er his head for ever, o\u2019er the doomed and dead. * At last once more uprising slow the Earth from Ocean green shall grow, and falls of water shimmering pour from her high shoulders to the shore; the eagle there with lonely cry shall hunt the fish on mountains high. The younger gods again shall meet in Idavellir\u2019s pastures sweet, and tales shall tell of ancient doom, the Serpent and the fire and gloom, and that old king of Gods recall his might and wisdom ere the fall. There marvellous shall again be found cast in the grass upon the ground the golden chess wherewith they played when \u00c1sgard long ago was made, when all their courts were filled with gold in the first merriment of old. A house I see that standeth there bright-builded, than the Sun more fair: o\u2019er Giml\u00e9 shine its tiles of gold, its halls no grief nor evil hold, and there shall worthy men and true in living days delight pursue. Unsown shall fields of wheat grow white when Baldur cometh after night; the ruined halls of \u00d3din\u2019s host, the windy towers on heaven\u2019s coast, shall golden be rebuilt again, all ills be healed in Baldur\u2019s reign.",
