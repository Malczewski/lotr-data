Indeed, although it was not then called The Silmarillion, it was already in being half a century ago; and in battered notebooks extending back to 1917 can still be read the earliest versions, often hastily pencilled, of the central stories of the mythology. But it was never published (though some indication of its content could be gleaned from The Lord of the Rings), and throughout my father\u2019s long life he never abandoned it, nor ceased even in his last years to work on it. In all that time The Silmarillion, considered simply as a large narrative structure, underwent relatively little radical change; it became long ago a fixed tradition, and background to later writings. But it was far indeed from being a fixed text, and did not remain unchanged even in certain fundamental ideas concerning the nature of the world it portrays; while the same legends came to be retold in longer and shorter forms, and in different styles. As the years passed the changes and variants, both in detail and in larger perspectives, became so complex, so pervasive, and so many-layered that a final and definitive version seemed unattainable. Moreover the old legends (\u2018old\u2019 now not only in their derivation from the remote First Age, but also in terms of my father\u2019s life) became the vehicle and depository of his profoundest reflections. In his later writing mythology and poetry sank down behind his theological and philosophical preoccupations: from which arose incompatibilities of tone.",

It became clear to me that to attempt to present, within the covers of a single book, the diversity of the materials \u2013 to show The Silmarillion as in truth a continuing and evolving creation extending over more than half a century \u2013 would in fact lead only to confusion and the submerging of what is essential. I set myself therefore to work out a single text, selecting and arranging in such a way as seemed to me to produce the most coherent and internally self-consistent narrative. In this work the concluding chapters (from the death of T\u00farin Turambar) introduced peculiar difficulties, in that they had remained unchanged for many years, and were in some respects in serious disharmony with more developed conceptions in other parts of the book.",

Moreover, my father come to conceive The Silmarillion as a compilation, a compendious narrative, made long afterwards from sources of great diversity (poems, and annals, and oral tales) that had survived in agelong tradition; and this conception has indeed its parallel in the actual history of the book, for a great deal of earlier prose and poetry does underlie it, and it is to some extent a compendium in fact and not only in theory. To this may be ascribed the varying speed of the narrative and fullness of detail in different parts, the contrast (for example) of the precise recollections of place and motive in the legend of T\u00farin Turambar beside the high and remote account of the end of the First Age, when Thangorodrim was broken and Morgoth overthrown; and also some differences of tone and portrayal, some obscurities, and, here and there, some lack of cohesion. In the case of the Valaquenta, for instance, we have to assume that while it contains much that must go back to the earliest days of the Eldar in Valinor, it was remodelled in later times; and thus explain its continual shifting of tense and viewpoint, so that the divine powers seem now present and active in the world, now remote, a vanished order known only to memory.",

But I have never stopped, and of course, as a professional philologist (especially interested in linguistic aesthetics), I have changed in taste, improved in theory, and probably in craft. Behind my stories is now a nexus of languages (mostly only structurally sketched). But to those creatures which in English I call misleadingly Elves are assigned two related languages more nearly completed, whose history is written, and whose forms (representing two different sides of my own linguistic taste) are deduced scientifically from a common origin. Out of these languages are made nearly all the names that appear in my legends. This gives a certain character (a cohesion, a consistency of linguistic style, and an illusion of historicity) to the nomenclature, or so I believe, that is markedly lacking in other comparable things. Not all will feel this as important as I do, since I am cursed by acute sensibility in such matters.",

There was Greek, and Celtic, and Romance, Germanic, Scandinavian, and Finnish (which greatly affected me); but nothing English, save impoverished chap-book stuff.

With Mortality, especially as it affects art and the creative (or as I should say, sub-creative) desire which seems to have no biological function, and to be apart from the satisfactions of plain ordinary biological life, with which, in our world, it is indeed usually at strife. This desire is at once wedded to a passionate love of the real primary world, and hence filled with the sense of mortality, and yet unsatisfied by it.

This Light thus lived thereafter only in these gems. The fall of the Elves comes about through the possessive attitude of F\u00ebanor and his seven sons to these gems. They are captured by the Enemy, set in his Iron Crown, and guarded in his impenetrable stronghold. The sons of F\u00ebanor take a terrible and blasphemous oath of enmity and vengeance against all or any, even of the gods, who dares to claim any part or right in the Silmarilli. They pervert the greater part of their kindred, who rebel against the gods, and depart from paradise, and go to make hopeless war upon the Enemy. The first fruit of their fall is war in Paradise, the slaying of Elves by Elves, and this and their evil oath dogs all their later heroism, generating treacheries and undoing all victories. The Silmarillion is the history of the War of the Exiled Elves against the Enemy, which all takes place in the North-west of the world (Middle-earth). Several tales of victory and tragedy are caught up in it; but it ends with catastrophe, and the passing of the Ancient World, the world of the long First Age. The jewels are recovered (by the final intervention of the gods) only to be lost for ever to the Elves, one in the sea, one in the deeps of earth, and one as a star of heaven. This legendarium ends with a vision of the end of the world, its breaking and remaking, and the recovery of the Silmarilli and the \u2018light before the Sun\u2019 \u2013 after a final battle which owes, I suppose, more to the Norse vision of Ragnar\u00f6k than to anything else, though it is not much like it.",

For the most part these are \u2018good Men\u2019 \u2013 families and their chiefs who rejecting the service of Evil, and hearing rumours of the Gods of the West and the High Elves, flee westward and come into contact with the Exiled Elves in the midst of their war. The Men who appear are mainly those of the Three Houses of the Fathers of Men, whose chieftains become allies of the Elflords. The contact of Men and Elves already fore-shadows the history of the later Ages, and a recurrent theme is the idea that in Men (as they now are) there is a strand of \u2018blood\u2019 and inheritance, derived from the Elves, and that the art and poetry of Men is largely dependent on it, or modified by it.* There are thus two marriages of mortal and elf \u2013 both later coalescing in the kindred of E\u00e4rendil, represented by Elrond the Half-elven who appears in all the stories, even The Hobbit. The chief of the stories of The Silmarillion, and the one most fully treated is the Story of Beren and L\u00fathien the Elfmaiden. Here we meet, among other things, the first example of the motive (to become dominant in Hobbits) that the great policies of world history, \u2018the wheels of the world\u2019, are often turned not by the Lords and Governors, even gods, but by the seemingly unknown and weak \u2013 owing to the secret life in creation, and the part unknowable to all wisdom but One, that resides in the intrusions of the Children of God into the Drama. It is Beren the outlawed mortal who succeeds (with the help of L\u00fathien, a mere maiden even if an elf of royalty) where all the armies and warriors have failed: he penetrates the stronghold of the Enemy and wrests one of the Silmarilli from the Iron Crown. Thus he wins the hand of L\u00fathien and the first marriage of mortal and immortal is achieved.",

There is the Children of H\u00farin, the tragic tale of T\u00farin Turambar and his sister N\u00edniel \u2013 of which T\u00farin is the hero: a figure that might be said (by people who like that sort of thing, though it is not very useful) to be derived from elements in Sigurd the Volsung, Oedipus, and the Finnish Kullervo. There is the Fall of Gondolin: the chief Elvish stronghold. And the tale, or tales, of E\u00e4rendil the Wanderer. He is important as the person who brings the Silmarillion to its end, and as providing in his offspring the main links to and persons in the tales of later Ages. His function, as a representative of both Kindreds, Elves and Men, is to find a sea-passage back to the Land of the Gods, and as ambassador persuade them to take thought again for the Exiles, to pity them, and rescue them from the Enemy. His wife Elwing descends from L\u00fathien and still possesses the Silmaril. But the curse still works, and E\u00e4rendil\u2019s home is destroyed by the sons of F\u00ebanor. But this provides the solution: Elwing casting herself into the Sea to save the Jewel comes to E\u00e4rendil, and with the power of the great Gem they pass at last to Valinor, and accomplish their errand \u2013 at the cost of never being allowed to return or dwell again with Elves or Men. The gods then move again, and great power comes out of the West, and the Stronghold of the Enemy is destroyed; and he himself [is] thrust out of the World into the Void, never to reappear there in incarnate form again. The remaining two Silmarils are regained from the Iron Crown \u2013 only to be lost. The last two sons of F\u00ebanor, compelled by their oath, steal them, and are destroyed by them, casting themselves into the sea, and the pits of the earth.

In the great battles against the First Enemy the lands were broken and ruined, and the West of Middle-earth became desolate. We learn that the Exiled Elves were, if not commanded, at least sternly counselled to return into the West, and there be at peace. They were not to dwell permanently in Valinor again, but in the Lonely Isle of Eress\u00eba within sight of the Blessed Realm. The Men of the Three Houses were rewarded for their valour and faithful alliance, by being allowed to dwell \u2018westernmost of all mortals\u2019, in the great \u2018Atlantis\u2019 isle of N\u00famen\u00f3re. The doom or gift of God, of mortality, the gods of course cannot abrogate, but the N\u00famen\u00f3reans have a great span of life. They set sail and leave Middle-earth, and establish a great kingdom of mariners just within furthest sight of Eress\u00eba (but not of Valinor). Most of the High Elves depart also back into the West. Not all. Some men akin to the N\u00famen\u00f3reans remain in the land not far from the shores of the Sea. Some of the Exiles will not return, or delay their return (for the way west is ever open to the immortals and in the Grey Havens ships are ever ready to sail away for ever). Also the Orcs (goblins) and other monsters bred by the First Enemy are not wholly destroyed. And there is Sauron. In the Silmarillion and Tales of the First Age Sauron was a being of Valinor perverted to the service of the Enemy and becoming his chief captain and servant. He repents in fear when the First Enemy is utterly defeated, but in the end does not do as was commanded, return to the judgement of the gods. He lingers in Middle-earth. Very slowly, beginning with fair motives: the reorganising and rehabilitation of the ruin of Middle-earth, \u2018neglected by the gods\u2019, he becomes a re-incarnation of Evil, and a thing lusting for Complete Power \u2013 and so consumed ever more fiercely with hate (especially of gods and Elves). All through the twilight of the Second Age the Shadow is growing in the East of Middle-earth, spreading its sway more and more over Men \u2013 who multiply as the Elves begin to fade. The three main themes are thus The Delaying Elves that lingered in Middle-earth; Sauron\u2019s growth to a new Dark Lord, master and god of Men; and N\u00famenor-Atlantis. They are dealt with annalistically, and in two Tales or Accounts, The Rings of Power and the Downfall of N\u00famenor. Both are the essential background to The Hobbit and its sequel.",

There was nothing wrong essentially in their lingering against counsel, still sadly with* the mortal lands of their old heroic deeds. But they wanted to have their cake without eating it. They wanted the peace and bliss and perfect memory of \u2018The West\u2019, and yet to remain on the ordinary earth where their prestige as the highest people, above wild Elves, dwarves, and Men, was greater than at the bottom of the hierarchy of Valinor. They thus became obsessed with \u2018fading\u2019, the mode in which the changes of time (the law of the world under the sun) was perceived by them. They became sad, and their art (shall we say) antiquarian, and their efforts all really a kind of embalming \u2013 even though they also retained the old motive of their kind, the adornment of earth, and the healing of its hurts. We hear of a lingering kingdom, in the extreme North-west more or less in what was left in the old lands of The Silmarillion, under Gilgalad; and of other settlements, such as Imladris (Rivendell) near Elrond; and a great one at Eregion at the Western feet of the Misty Mountains, adjacent to the Mines of Moria, the major realm of the Dwarves in the Second Age. There arose a friendship between the usually hostile folk (of Elves and Dwarves) for the first and only time, and smithcraft reached its highest development. But many of the Elves listened to Sauron. He was still fair in that early time, and his motives and those of the Elves seemed to go partly together: the healing of the desolate lands. Sauron found their weak point in suggesting that, helping one another, they could make Western Middle-earth as beautiful as Valinor. It was really a veiled attack on the gods, an incitement to try and make a separate independent paradise. Gilgalad repulsed all such overtures, as also did Elrond. But at Eregion great work began \u2013 and the Elves came their nearest to falling to \u2018magic\u2019 and machinery. With the aid of Sauron\u2019s lore they made Rings of Power (\u2018power\u2019 is an ominous and sinister word in all these tales, except as applied to the gods).",

In all other directions they could go as they would. They must not set foot on \u2018immortal\u2019 lands, and so become enamoured of an immortality (within the world), which was against their law, the special doom or gift of Il\u00favatar (God), and which their nature could not in fact endure.*",

Then Melkor saw what was done, and that the Valar walked on Earth as powers visible, clad in the raiment of the World, and were lovely and glorious to see, and blissful, and that the Earth was becoming as a garden for their delight, for its turmoils were subdued. His envy grew then the greater within him; and he also took visible form, but because of his mood and the malice that burned in him that form was dark and terrible. And he descended upon Arda in power and majesty greater than any other of the Valar, as a mountain that wades in the sea and has its head above the clouds and is clad in ice and crowned with smoke and fire; and the light of the eyes of Melkor was like a flame that withers with heat and pierces with a deadly cold.",

For what has here been declared is come from the Valar themselves, with whom the Eldali\u00eb spoke in the land of Valinor, and by whom they were instructed; but little would the Valar ever tell of the wars before the coming of the Elves. Yet it is told among the Eldar that the Valar endeavoured ever, in despite of Melkor, to rule the Earth and to prepare it for the coming of the Firstborn; and they built lands and Melkor destroyed them; valleys they delved and Melkor raised them up; mountains they carved and Melkor threw them down; seas they hollowed and Melkor spilled them; and naught might have peace or come to lasting growth, for as surely as the Valar began a labour so would Melkor undo it or corrupt it. And yet their labour was not all in vain; and though nowhere and in no work was their will and purpose wholly fulfilled, and all things were in hue and shape other than the Valar had at first intended, slowly nonetheless the Earth was fashioned and made firm. And thus was the habitation of the Children of Il\u00favatar established at the last in the Deeps of Time and amidst the innumerable stars.",

If he is less strong than Tulkas, he is more dreadful in anger; whereas Tulkas laughs ever, in sport or in war, and even in the face of Melkor he laughed in battles before the Elves were born. Orom\u00eb loved the lands of Middle-earth, and he left them unwillingly and came last to Valinor; and often of old he passed back east over the mountains and returned with his host to the hills and the plains. He is a hunter of monsters and fell beasts, and he delights in horses and in hounds; and all trees he loves, for which reason he is called Aldaron, and by the Sindar Tauron, the Lord of Forests. Nahar is the name of his horse, white in the sun, and shining silver at night. The Valar\u00f3ma is the name of his great horn, the sound of which is like the upgoing of the Sun in scarlet, or the sheer lightning cleaving the clouds. Above all the horns of his host it was heard in the woods that Yavanna brought forth in Valinor; for there Orom\u00eb would train his folk and his beasts for the pursuit of the evil creatures of Melkor. The spouse of Orom\u00eb is V\u00e1na, the Ever-young; she is the younger sister of Yavanna. All flowers spring as she passes and open if she glances upon them; and all birds sing at her coming.",

Green things fell sick and rotted, and rivers were choked with weeds and slime, and fens were made, rank and poisonous, the breeding place of flies; and forests grew dark and perilous, the haunts of fear; and beasts became monsters of horn and ivory and dyed the earth with blood. Then the Valar knew indeed that Melkor was at work again, and they sought for his hiding place. But Melkor, trusting in the strength of Utumno and the might of his servants, came forth suddenly to war, and struck the first blow, ere the Valar were prepared; and he assailed the lights of Illuin and Ormal, and cast down their pillars and broke their lamps. In the overthrow of the mighty pillars lands were broken and seas arose in tumult; and when the lamps were spilled destroying flame was poured out over the Earth. And the shape of Arda and the symmetry of its waters and its lands was marred in that time, so that the first designs of the Valar were never after restored.",

For which reason the Valar are to these kindreds rather their elders and their chieftains than their masters; and if ever in their dealings with Elves and Men the Ainur have endeavoured to force them when they would not be guided, seldom has this turned to good, howsoever good the intent. The dealings of the Ainur have indeed been mostly with the Elves, for Il\u00favatar made them more like in nature to the Ainur, though less in might and stature; whereas to Men he gave strange gifts.",

And it came to pass after many years of journeying in this manner that the Eldar took their course through a forest, and they came to a great river, wider than any they had yet seen; and beyond it were mountains whose sharp horns seemed to pierce the realm of the stars. This river, it is said, was even the river which was after called Anduin the Great, and was ever the frontier of the west-lands of Middle-earth. But the mountains were the Hithaeglir, the Towers of Mist upon the borders of Eriador; yet they were taller and more terrible in those days, and were reared by Melkor to hinder the riding of Orom\u00eb. Now the Teleri abode long on the east bank of that river and wished to remain there, but the Vanyar and the Noldor passed over it, and Orom\u00eb led them into the passes of the mountains.

Then Morgoth sent forth a terrible cry, that echoed in the mountains. Therefore that region was called Lammoth; for the echoes of his voice dwelt there ever after, so that any who cried aloud in that land awoke them, and all the waste between the hills and the sea was filled with a clamour as of voices in anguish. The cry of Morgoth in that hour was the greatest and most dreadful that was ever heard in the northern world; the mountains shook, and the earth trembled, and rocks were riven asunder. Deep in forgotten places that cry was heard. Far beneath the ruined halls of Angband, in vaults to which the Valar in the haste of their assault had not descended, Balrogs lurked still, awaiting ever the return of their Lord; and now swiftly they arose, and passing over Hithlum they came to Lammoth as a tempest of fire. With their whips of flame they smote asunder the webs of Ungoliant, and she quailed, and turned to flight, belching black vapours to cover her; and fleeing from the north she went down into Beleriand, and dwelt beneath Ered Gorgoroth, in that dark valley that was after called Nan Dungortheb, the Valley of Dreadful Death, because of the horror that she bred there. For other foul creatures of spider form had dwelt there since the days of the delving of Angband, and she mated with them, and devoured them; and even after Ungoliant herself departed, and went whither she would into the forgotten south of the world, her offspring abode there and wove their hideous webs. Of the fate of Ungoliant no tale tells. Yet some have said that she ended long ago, when in her uttermost famine she devoured herself at last.",

There he delved anew his vast vaults and dungeons, and above their gates he reared the threefold peaks of Thangorodrim, and a great reek of dark smoke was ever wreathed about them. There countless became the hosts of his beasts and his demons, and the race of the Orcs, bred long before, grew and multiplied in the bowels of the earth.

Finrod was with Turgon, his friend; but Galadriel, the only woman of the Noldor to stand that day tall and valiant among the contending princes, was eager to be gone. No oaths she swore, but the words of F\u00ebanor concerning Middle-earth had kindled in her heart, for she yearned to see the wide unguarded lands and to rule there a realm at her own will.

And they became known as Ered Gorgoroth, the Mountains of Terror, and none dared go thither, or pass nigh them; there life and light were strangled, and there all waters were poisoned.

Thus they held vigil in the night of Valinor, and their thought passed back beyond E\u00e4 and forth to the End; yet neither power nor wisdom assuaged their grief, and the knowing of evil in the hour of its being.

For F\u00ebanor was made the mightiest in all parts of body and mind, in valour, in endurance, in beauty, in understanding, in skill, in strength and in subtlety alike, of all the Children of Il\u00favatar, and a bright flame was in him. The works of wonder for the glory of Arda that he might otherwise have wrought only Manw\u00eb might in some measure conceive. And it was told by the Vanyar who held vigil with the Valar that when the messengers declared to Manw\u00eb the answers of F\u00ebanor to his heralds, Manw\u00eb wept and bowed his head. But at that last word of F\u00ebanor: that at the least the Noldor should do deeds to live in song for ever, he raised his head, as one that hears a voice far off, and he said: \u2018So shall it be! Dear-bought those songs shall be accounted, and yet shall be well-bought. For the price could be no other.

The Atani they were named by the Eldar, the Second People; but they called them also Hildor, the Followers, and many other names: Apan\u00f3nar, the After-born, Engwar, the Sickly, and F\u00edrimar, the Mortals; and they named them the Usurpers, the Strangers, and the Inscrutable, the Self-cursed, the Heavy-handed, the Night-fearers, the Children of the Sun. Of Men little is told in these tales, which concern the Eldest Days before the waxing of mortals and the waning of the Elves, save of those fathers of men, the Atanat\u00e1ri, who in the first years of the Sun and Moon wandered into the North of the world. To Hild\u00f3rien there came no Vala to guide Men, or to summon them to dwell in Valinor; and Men have feared the Valar, rather than loved them, and have not understood the purposes of the Powers, being at variance with them, and at strife with the world. Ulmo nonetheless took thought for them, aiding the counsel and will of Manw\u00eb; and his messages came often to them by stream and flood. But they have not skill in such matters, and still less had they in those days before they had mingled with the Elves. Therefore they loved the waters, and their hearts were stirred, but they understood not the messages. Yet it is told that ere long they met Dark Elves in many places, and were befriended by them; and Men became the companions and disciples in their childhood of these ancient folk, wanderers of the Elven-race who never set out upon the paths to Valinor, and knew of the Valar only as a rumour and a distant name.",

No love was there in the hearts of those that followed Fingolfin for the House of F\u00ebanor, for the agony of those that endured the crossing of the Ice had been great, and Fingolfin held the sons the accomplices of their father. Then there was peril of strife between the hosts; but grievous as were their losses upon the road, the people of Fingolfin and of Finrod son of Finarfin were still more numerous than the followers of F\u00ebanor, and these now withdrew before them, and removed their dwelling to the southern shore; and the lake lay between them. Many of F\u00ebanor\u2019s people indeed repented of the burning at Losgar, and were filled with amazement at the valour that had brought the friends whom they had abandoned over the Ice of the North; and they would have welcomed them, but they dared not, for shame.",

Therefore he dared a deed which is justly renowned among the feats of the princes of the Noldor: alone, and without the counsel of any, he set forth in search of Maedhros; and aided by the very darkness that Morgoth had made he came unseen into the fastness of his foes. High upon the shoulders of Thangorodrim he climbed, and looked in despair upon the desolation of the land; but no passage or crevice could he find through which he might come within Morgoth\u2019s stronghold. Then in defiance of the Orcs, who cowered still in the dark vaults beneath the earth, he took his harp and sang a song of Valinor that the Noldor made of old, before strife was born among the sons of Finw\u00eb; and his voice rang in the mournful hollows that had never heard before aught save cries of fear and woe.",

But Ulmo coming up the river laid a deep sleep upon them and heavy dreams; and the trouble of the dreams remained after they awoke, but neither said aught to the other, for their memory was not clear, and each believed that Ulmo had sent a message to him alone. But unquiet was upon them ever after, and doubt of what should befall, and they wandered often alone in untrodden lands, seeking far and wide for places of hidden strength; for it seemed to each that he was bidden to prepare for a day of evil, and to establish a retreat, lest Morgoth should burst from Angband and overthrow the armies of the North.",

Therefore he opened his heart to Thingol, telling him of his dreams; and Thingol spoke to him of the deep gorge of the River Narog, and the caves under the High Faroth in its steep western shore, and when he departed he gave him guides to lead him to that place of which few yet knew. Thus Finrod came to the Caverns of Narog, and began to establish there deep halls and armouries after the fashion of the mansions of Menegroth; and that stronghold was called Nargothrond. In that labour Finrod was aided by the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains; and they were rewarded well, for Finrod had brought more treasures out of Tirion than any other of the princes of the Noldor. And in that time was made for him the Nauglam\u00edr, the Necklace of the Dwarves, most renowned of their works in the Elder Days. It was a carcanet of gold, and set therein were gems uncounted from Valinor; but it had a power within it so that it rested lightly on its wearer as a strand of flax, and whatsoever neck it clasped it sat always with grace and loveliness.",

Yet the Noldor could not capture Angband, nor could they regain the Silmarils; and war never wholly ceased in all that time of the Siege, for Morgoth devised new evils, and ever and anon he would make trial of his enemies. Nor could the stronghold of Morgoth be ever wholly encircled; for the Iron Mountains, from whose great curving wall the towers of Thangorodrim were thrust forward, defended it upon either side, and were impassable to the Noldor, because of their snow and ice. Thus in his rear and to the north Morgoth had no foes, and by that way his spies at times went out, and came by devious routes into Beleriand. And desiring above all to sow fear and disunion among the Eldar, he commanded the Orcs to take alive any of them that they could and bring them bound to Angband; and some he so daunted by the terror of his eyes that they needed no chains more, but walked ever in fear of him, doing his will wherever they might be. Thus Morgoth learned much of all that had befallen since the rebellion of F\u00ebanor, and he rejoiced, seeing therein the seed of many dissensions among his foes.",

Fingon won great praise, and the Noldor rejoiced; for few foresaw the full meaning and threat of this new thing.

In all that time there were but affrays on the marches, and all Beleriand prospered and grew rich.

Linaewen was the name of that mere, because of the multitude of birds that dwelt there, of such as love tall reeds and shallow pools.

All living things else shunned that land, and the Noldor would pass through Nan Dungortheb only at great need, by paths near to the borders of Doriath and furthest from the haunted hills.

But there was a deep way under the mountains delved in the darkness of the world by waters that flowed out to join the streams of Sirion; and this way Turgon found, and so came to the green plain amid the mountains, and saw the island-hill that stood there of hard smooth stone; for the vale had been a great lake in ancient days. Then Turgon knew that he had found the place of his desire, and he resolved to build there a fair city, a memorial of Tirion upon T\u00fana; but he returned to Nevrast, and remained there in peace, though he pondered ever in his thought how he should accomplish his design.",

But Turgon dwelt still for the most part in Nevrast, until it came to pass that at last the city was full-wrought, after two and fifty years of secret toil. It is said that Turgon appointed its name to be Ondolind\u00eb in the speech of the Elves of Valinor, the Rock of the Music of Water, for there were fountains upon the hill; but in the Sindarin tongue the name was changed, and it became Gondolin, the Hidden Rock. Then Turgon prepared to depart from Nevrast and leave his halls in Vinyamar beside the sea; and there Ulmo came to him once again, and spoke with him. And he said: \u2018Now thou shalt go at last to Gondolin, Turgon; and I will maintain my power in the Vale of Sirion, and in all the waters therein, so that none shall mark thy going, nor shall any find there the hidden entrance against thy will.

And as their friendship grew he would at times go and dwell as guest in the deep mansions of Nogrod or Belegost. There he learned much of metalwork, and came to great skill therein; and he devised a metal as hard as the steel of the Dwarves, but so malleable that he could make it thin and supple; and yet it remained resistant to all blades and darts. He named it galvorn, for it was black and shining like jet, and he was clad in it whenever he went abroad. But E\u00f6l, though stooped by his smithwork, was no Dwarf, but a tall Elf of a high kin of the Teleri, noble though grim of face; and his eyes could see deep into shadows and dark places. And it came to pass that he saw Aredhel Ar-Feiniel as she strayed among the tall trees near the borders of Nan Elmoth, a gleam of white in the dim land. Very fair she seemed to him, and he desired her; and he set his enchantments about her so that she could not find the ways out, but drew ever nearer to his dwelling in the depths of the wood. There were his smithy, and his dim halls, and such servants as he had, silent and secret as their master. And when Aredhel, weary with wandering, came at last to his doors, he revealed himself; and he welcomed her, and led her into his house. And there she remained; for E\u00f6l took her to wife, and it was long ere any of her kin heard of her again.",

And that was seen in after days: for when in the dread year of the Nirnaeth Arnoediad Turgon opened his leaguer and marched forth to the help of Fingon in the north, Maeglin would not remain in Gondolin as regent of the King, but went to the war and fought beside Turgon, and proved fell and fearless in battle.",

This counsel was wise according to the measure of his knowledge; for the Noldor did not yet comprehend the fullness of the power of Morgoth, nor understand that their unaided war upon him was without final hope, whether they hasted or delayed. But because the land was fair and their kingdoms wide, most of the Noldor were content with things as they were, trusting them to last, and slow to begin an assault in which many must surely perish were it in victory or in defeat. Therefore they were little disposed to hearken to Fingolfin, and the sons of F\u00ebanor at that time least of all. Among the chieftains of the Noldor Angrod and Aegnor alone were of like mind with the King; for they dwelt in regions whence Thangorodrim could be descried, and the threat of Morgoth was present to their thought. Thus the designs of Fingolfin came to naught, and the land had peace yet for a while.",

For Morgoth had long prepared his force in secret, while ever the malice of his heart grew greater, and his hatred of the Noldor more bitter; and he desired not only to end his foes but to destroy also and defile the lands that they had taken and made fair. And it is said that his hate overcame his counsel, so that if he had but endured to wait longer, until his designs were full, then the Noldor would have perished utterly.

The watchfires burned low, and the guards were few; on the plain few were waking in the camps of the horsemen of Hithlum. Then suddenly Morgoth sent forth great rivers of flame that ran down swifter than Balrogs from Thangorodrim, and poured over all the plain; and the Mountains of Iron belched forth fires of many poisonous hues, and the fume of them stank upon the air, and was deadly. Thus Ard-galen perished, and fire devoured its grasses; and it became a burned and desolate waste, full of a choking dust, barren and lifeless. Thereafter its name was changed, and it was called Anfauglith, the Gasping Dust. Many charred bones had there their roofless grave; for many of the Noldor perished in that burning, who were caught by the running flame and could not fly to the hills. The heights of Dorthonion and Ered Wethrin held back the fiery torrents, but their woods upon the slopes that looked towards Angband were all kindled, and the smoke wrought confusion among the defenders. Thus began the fourth of the great battles, Dagor Bragollach, the Battle of Sudden Flame.",

Then Morgoth pursued his people to the death, until few remained; and all the forest of the northward slopes of that land was turned little by little into a region of such dread and dark enchantment that even the Orcs would not enter it unless need drove them, and it was called Deld\u00fawath, and Taur-nu-Fuin, The Forest under Nightshade. The trees that grew there after the burning were black and grim, and their roots were tangled, groping in the dark like claws; and those who strayed among them became lost and blind, and were strangled or pursued to madness by phantoms of terror. At last so desperate was the case of Barahir that Emeldir the Manhearted his wife (whose mind was rather to fight beside her son and her husband than to flee) gathered together all the women and children that were left, and gave arms to those that would bear them; and she led them into the mountains that lay behind, and so by perilous paths, until they came at last with loss and misery to Brethil. Some were there received among the Haladin, but some passed on over the mountains to Dorl\u00f3min and the people of Galdor, Hador\u2019s son; and among those were R\u00edan, daughter of Belegund, and Morwen, who was named Eledhwen, that is Elfsheen, daughter of Baragund. But none ever saw again the men that they had left. For these were slain one by one, until at last only twelve men remained to Barahir: Beren his son, and Baragund and Belegund his nephews, the sons of Bregolas, and nine faithful servants of his house whose names were long remembered in the songs of the Noldor: Radhruin and Dairuin they were, Dagnir and Ragnor, Gildor and Gorlim the unhappy, Arthad and Urthel, and Hathaldir the young. Outlaws without hope they became, a desperate band that could not escape and would not yield, for their dwellings were destroyed, and their wives and children captured, slain, or fled. From Hithlum there came neither news nor help, and Barahir and his men were hunted like wild beasts; and they retreated to the barren highland above the forest, and wandered among the tarns and rocky moors of that region, furthest from the spies and spells of Morgoth. Their bed was the heather and their roof the cloudy sky.",

But at length, after the fall of Fingolfin, Sauron, greatest and most terrible of the servants of Morgoth, who in the Sindarin tongue was named Gorthaur, came against Orodreth, the warden of the tower upon Tol Sirion. Sauron was become now a sorcerer of dreadful power, master of shadows and of phantoms, foul in wisdom, cruel in strength, misshaping what he touched, twisting what he ruled, lord of werewolves; his dominion was torment. He took Minas Tirith by assault, for a dark cloud of fear fell upon those that defended it; and Orodreth was driven out, and fled to Nargothrond. Then Sauron made it into a watch-tower for Morgoth, a stronghold of evil, and a menace; and the fair isle of Tol Sirion became accursed, and it was called Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the Isle of Werewolves. No living creature could pass through that vale that Sauron did not espy from the tower where he sat. And Morgoth held now the western pass, and his terror filled the fields and woods of Beleriand. Beyond Hithlum he pursued his foes relentlessly, and he searched out their hiding-places and took their strongholds one by one. The Orcs growing ever bolder wandered at will far and wide, coming down Sirion in the west and Celon in the east, and they encompassed Doriath; and they harried the lands so that beast and bird fled before them, and silence and desolation spread steadily from the North. Many of the Noldor and the Sindar they took captive and led to Angband, and made them thralls, forcing them to use their skill and their knowledge in the service of Morgoth. And Morgoth sent out his spies, and they were clad in false forms and deceit was in their speech; they made lying promises of reward, and with cunning words sought to arouse fear and jealousy among the peoples, accusing their kings and chieftains of greed, and of treachery one to another. And because of the curse of the Kinslaying at Alqualond\u00eb these lies were often believed; and indeed as the time darkened they had a measure of truth, for the hearts and minds of the Elves of Beleriand became clouded with despair and fear. But ever the Noldor feared most the treachery of those of their own kin, who had been thralls in Angband; for Morgoth used some of these for his evil purposes, and feigning to give them liberty sent them abroad, but their wills were chained to his, and they strayed only to come back to him again. Therefore if any of his captives escaped in truth, and returned to their own people, they had little welcome, and wandered alone outlawed and desperate.",

Their houses were many, and some had greater liking for the Dwarves of the mountains than for the Elves. But Maedhros, knowing the weakness of the Noldor and the Edain, whereas the pits of Angband seemed to hold store inexhaustible and ever-renewed, made alliance with these new-come Men, and gave his friendship to the greatest of their chieftains, B\u00f3r and Ulfang.

And now Celegorm and Curufin are dwelling in my halls; and though I, Finarfin\u2019s son, am King, they have won a strong power in the realm, and lead many of their own people. They have shown friendship to me in every need, but I fear that they will show neither love nor mercy to you, if your quest be told. Yet my own oath holds; and thus we are all ensnared.\u2019",

Therefore they took their hounds and rode forth; and they thought that ere they returned they might also hear tidings concerning King Felagund. Now the chief of the wolf-hounds that followed Celegorm was named Huan. He was not born in Middle-earth, but came from the Blessed Realm; for Orom\u00eb had given him to Celegorm long ago in Valinor, and there he had followed the horn of his master, before evil came. Huan followed Celegorm into exile, and was faithful; and thus he too came under the doom of woe set upon the Noldor, and it was decreed that he should meet death, but not until he encountered the mightiest wolf that would ever walk the world.",

There Beren slunk in wolf\u2019s form beneath his throne; but L\u00fathien was stripped of her disguise by the will of Morgoth, and he bent his gaze upon her. She was not daunted by his eyes; and she named her own name, and offered her service to sing before him, after the manner of a minstrel. Then Morgoth looking upon her beauty conceived in his thought an evil lust, and a design more dark than any that had yet come into his heart since he fled from Valinor. Thus he was beguiled by his own malice, for he watched her, leaving her free for a while, and taking secret pleasure in his thought. Then suddenly she eluded his sight, and out of the shadows began a song of such surpassing loveliness, and of such blinding power, that he listened perforce; and a blindness came upon him, as his eyes roamed to and fro, seeking her.",

Then Beren and L\u00fathien went forth alone, fearing neither thirst nor hunger; and they passed beyond the River Gelion into Ossiriand, and dwelt there in Tol Galen the green isle, in the midst of Adurant, until all tidings of them ceased. The Eldar afterwards called that country Dor Firn-i-Guinar, the Land of the Dead that Live; and there was born Dior Aranel the beautiful, who was after known as Dior Eluch\u00edl, which is Thingol\u2019s Heir.

Then hope was renewed in the hearts of the Elves; and in that very time, at the third hour of morning, the trumpets of Maedhros were heard at last coming up from the east, and the banners of the sons of F\u00ebanor assailed the enemy in the rear.

But even as the vanguard of Maedhros came upon the Orcs, Morgoth loosed his last strength, and Angband was emptied. There came wolves, and wolfriders, and there came Balrogs, and dragons, and Glaurung father of dragons. The strength and terror of the Great Worm were now great indeed, and Elves and Men withered before him; and he came between the hosts of Maedhros and Fingon and swept them apart.",

But so great was the beauty and majesty of the Lady of Dor-l\u00f3min that the Easterlings were afraid, and dared not to lay hands upon her or her household; and they whispered among themselves, saying that she was perilous, and a witch skilled in magic and in league with the Elves. Yet she was now poor and without aid, save that she was succoured secretly by a kinswoman of H\u00farin named Aerin, whom Brodda, an Easterling, had taken as his wife; and Morwen feared greatly that T\u00farin would be taken from her and enslaved. Therefore it came into her heart to send him away in secret, and to beg King Thingol to harbour him, for Beren son of Barahir was her father\u2019s kinsman, and he had been moreover a friend of H\u00farin, ere evil befell. Therefore in the autumn of the Year of Lamentation Morwen sent T\u00farin forth over the mountains with two aged servants, bidding them find entry, if they could, into the kingdom of Doriath.

For M\u00eem came of Dwarves that were banished in ancient days from the great Dwarf-cities of the east, and long before the return of Morgoth they wandered westward into Beleriand; but they became diminished in stature and in smith-craft, and they took to lives of stealth, walking with bowed shoulders and furtive steps. Before the Dwarves of Nogrod and Belegost came west over the mountains the Elves of Beleriand knew not what these others were, and they hunted them, and slew them; but afterwards they let them alone, and they were called Noegyth Nibin, the Petty-Dwarves, in the Sindarin tongue. They loved none but themselves, and if they feared and hated the Orcs, they hated the Eldar no less, and the Exiles most of all; for the Noldor, they said, had stolen their lands and their homes. Long ere King Finrod Felagund came over the Sea, the caves of Nargothrond were discovered by them, and by them its delving was begun; and beneath the crown of Amon R\u00fbdh, the Bald Hill, the slow hands of the Petty-Dwarves had bored and deepened the caves through the long years that they dwelt there, untroubled by the Grey-elves of the woods. But now at last they had dwindled and died out of Middle-earth, all save M\u00eem and his two sons; and M\u00eem was old even in the reckoning of Dwarves, old and forgotten. And in his halls the smithies were idle, and the axes rusted, and their name was remembered only in ancient tales of Doriath and Nargothrond.",

Thence the road went on into the Guarded Plain; but the Orcs did not go far upon it, as yet, for there dwelt now in the wild a terror that was hidden, and upon the red hill were watchful eyes of which they had not been warned. For T\u00farin put on again the Helm of Hador; and far and wide in Beleriand the whisper went, under wood and over stream and through the passes of the hills, saying that the Helm and Bow that had fallen in Dimbar had arisen again beyond hope. Then many who went leaderless, dispossessed but undaunted, took heart again, and came to seek the Two Captains. Dor-C\u00faarthol, the Land of Bow and Helm, was in that time named all the region between Teiglin and the west march of Doriath; and T\u00farin named himself anew, Gorthol, the Dread Helm, and his heart was high again. In Menegroth, and in the deep halls of Nargothrond, and even in the hidden realm of Gondolin, the fame of the deeds of the Two Captains was heard; and in Angband also they were known.

Therefore the woodmen lifted him up, and bore him away to their homes. Now those were set in a stockade upon a high place in the forest, Ephel Brandir upon Amon Obel; for the People of Haleth were now dwindled by war, and Brandir son of Handir who ruled them was a man of gentle mood, and lame also from childhood, and he trusted rather in secrecy than in deeds of war to save them from the power of the North. Therefore he feared the tidings that Dorlas brought, and when he beheld the face of T\u00farin as he lay on the bier a cloud of foreboding lay on his heart. Nonetheless being moved by his woe he took him into his own house and tended him, for he had skill in healing. And with the beginning of spring T\u00farin cast off his darkness, and grew hale again; and he arose, and he thought that he would remain in Brethil hidden, and put his shadow behind him, forsaking the past. He took therefore a new name, Turambar, which in the High-elven speech signified Master of Doom; and he besought the woodmen to forget that he was a stranger among them or ever bore any other name. Nonetheless he would not wholly leave deeds of war; for he could not endure that the Orcs should come to the Crossings of Teiglin or draw nigh to Haudh-en-Elleth, and he made that a place of dread for them, so that they shunned it.

For Melian was of the divine race of the Valar, and she was a Maia of great power and wisdom; but for love of Elw\u00eb Singollo she took upon herself the form of the Elder Children of Il\u00favatar, and in that union she became bound by the chain and trammels of the flesh of Arda.

For three years he endured that thraldom, but at the end of that time he escaped; and returning to the caves of Androth he dwelt there alone, and did such great hurt to the Easterlings that Lorgan set a price upon his head.",

The fume of the burning, and the steam of the fair fountains of Gondolin withering in the flame of the dragons of the north, fell upon the vale of Tumladen in mournful mists; and thus was the escape of Tuor and his company aided, for there was still a long and open road to follow from the tunnel\u2019s mouth to the foothills of the mountains.

For though the Valar had rewarded the D\u00fanedain with long life, they could not take from them the weariness of the world that comes at last, and they died, even their kings of the seed of E\u00e4rendil; and the span of their lives was brief in the eyes of the Eldar.

And the N\u00famen\u00f3reans began to murmur, at first in their hearts, and then in open words, against the doom of Men, and most of all against the Ban which forbade them to sail into the West.",

And the Doom of Men, that they should depart, was at first a gift of Il\u00favatar. It became a grief to them only because coming under the shadow of Morgoth it seemed to them that they were surrounded by a great darkness, of which they were afraid; and some grew wilful and proud and would not yield, until life was reft from them. We who bear the ever-mounting burden of the years do not clearly understand this; but if that grief has returned to trouble you, as you say, then we fear that the Shadow arises once more and grows again in your hearts. Therefore, though you be the D\u00fanedain, fairest of Men, who escaped from the Shadow of old and fought valiantly against it, we say to you: Beware! The will of Eru may not be gainsaid; and the Valar bid you earnestly not to withhold the trust to which you are called, lest soon it become again a bond by which you are constrained. Hope rather that in the end even the least of your desires shall have fruit. The love of Arda was set in your hearts by Il\u00favatar, and he does not plant to no purpose.

And the twentieth king took the sceptre of his fathers, and he ascended the throne in the name of Ad\u00fbnakh\u00f4r, Lord of the West, forsaking the Elven-tongues and forbidding their use in his hearing. Yet in the Scroll of Kings the name Herun\u00famen was inscribed in the High-elven speech, because of ancient custom, which the kings feared to break utterly, lest evil befall. Now this title seemed to the Faithful over-proud, being the title of the Valar; and their hearts were sorely tried between their loyalty to the House of Elros and their reverence of the appointed Powers. But worse was yet to come. For Ar-Gimilz\u00f4r the twenty-third king was the greatest enemy of the Faithful. In his day the White Tree was untended and began to decline; and he forbade utterly the use of the Elven-tongues, and punished those that welcomed the ships of Eress\u00eba, that still came secretly to the west-shores of the land.",

Yet there dwelt still a remnant of the Faithful, as has been told, at R\u00f3menna and in the country near, and other few there were here and there in the land. The chief among them, to whom they looked for leading and courage in evil days, was Amandil, councillor of the King, and his son Elendil, whose sons were Isildur and An\u00e1rion, then young men by the reckoning of N\u00famenor. Amandil and Elendil were great ship-captains; and they were of the line of Elros Tar-Minyatur, though not of the ruling house to whom belonged the crown and the throne in the city of Armenelos. In the days of their youth together Amandil had been dear to Pharaz\u00f4n, and though he was of the Elf-friends he remained in his council until the coming of Sauron. Now he was dismissed, for Sauron hated him above all others in N\u00famenor. But he was so noble, and had been so mighty a captain of the sea, that he was still held in honour by many of the people, and neither the King nor Sauron dared to lay hands on him as yet.",

But when Amandil heard rumour of the evil purpose of Sauron he was grieved to the heart, knowing that in the end Sauron would surely have his will. Then he spoke to Elendil and the sons of Elendil, recalling the tale of the Trees of Valinor; and Isildur said no word, but went out by night and did a deed for which he was afterwards renowned. For he passed alone in disguise to Armenelos and to the courts of the King, which were now forbidden to the Faithful; and he came to the place of the Tree, which was forbidden to all by the orders of Sauron, and the Tree was watched day and night by guards in his service. At that time Nimloth was dark and bore no bloom, for it was late in the autumn, and its winter was nigh; and Isildur passed through the guards and took from the Tree a fruit that hung upon it, and turned to go. But the guard was aroused, and he was assailed, and fought his way out, receiving many wounds; and he escaped, and because he was disguised it was not discovered who had laid hands on the Tree. But Isildur came at last hardly back to R\u00f3menna and delivered the fruit to the hands of Amandil, ere his strength failed him. Then the fruit was planted in secret, and it was blessed by Amandil; and a shoot arose from it and sprouted in the spring. But when its first leaf opened then Isildur, who had lain long and come near to death, arose and was troubled no more by his wounds.",

And that dome was roofed all with silver, and rose glittering in the sun, so that the light of it could be seen afar off; but soon the light was darkened, and the silver became black. For there was an altar of fire in the midst of the temple, and in the topmost of the dome there was a louver, whence there issued a great smoke. And the first fire upon the altar Sauron kindled with the hewn wood of Nimloth, and it crackled and was consumed; but men marvelled at the reek that went up from it, so that the land lay under a cloud for seven days, until slowly it passed into the west.",

But when the devouring wave rolled over the land and N\u00famenor toppled to its fall, then he would have been overwhelmed and would have deemed it the lesser grief to perish, for no wrench of death could be more bitter than the loss and agony of that day; but the great wind took him, wilder than any wind that Men had known, roaring from the west, and it swept his ships far away; and it rent their sails and snapped their masts, hunting the unhappy men like straws upon the water.",

Seven rings he gave to the Dwarves; but to Men he gave nine, for Men proved in this matter as in others the readiest to his will. And all those rings that he governed he perverted, the more easily since he had a part in their making, and they were accursed, and they betrayed in the end all those that used them. The Dwarves indeed proved tough and hard to tame; they ill endure the domination of others, and the thoughts of their hearts are hard to fathom, nor can they be turned to shadows. They used their rings only for the getting of wealth; but wrath and an overmastering greed of gold were kindled in their hearts, of which evil enough after came to the profit of Sauron. It is said that the foundation of each of the Seven Hoards of the Dwarf-kings of old was a golden ring; but all those hoards long ago were plundered and the Dragons devoured them, and of the Seven Rings some were consumed in fire and some Sauron recovered.",

He brooked no freedom nor any rivalry, and he named himself Lord of the Earth. A mask he still could wear so that if he wished he might deceive the eyes of Men, seeming to them wise and fair.

Thus the Black Years began, which the Elves call the Days of Flight. In that time many of the Elves of Middle-earth fled to Lindon and thence over the seas never to return; and many were destroyed by Sauron and his servants. But in Lindon Gil-galad still maintained his power, and Sauron dared not as yet to pass the Mountains of Ered Luin nor to assail the Havens; and Gil-galad was aided by the N\u00famen\u00f3reans. Elsewhere Sauron reigned, and those who would be free took refuge in the fastnesses of wood and mountain, and ever fear pursued them. In the east and south well nigh all Men were under his dominion, and they grew strong in those days and built many towns and walls of stone, and they were numerous and fierce in war and armed with iron.

Ad\u00fbnaic ad\u00fbn in Ad\u00fbnakh\u00f4r, Anad\u00fbn\u00ea was a loan from Eldarin speech. anga \u2018iron\u2019, Sindarin ang, in Angainor, Angband, Anghabar, Anglachel, Angrist, Angrod, Anguirel, Gurthang; angren \u2018of iron\u2019 in Angrenost, plural engrin in Ered Engrin. anna \u2018gift\u2019 in Annatar, Melian, Yavanna; the same stem in Andor \u2018Land of Gift\u2019. annon \u2018great door or gate\u2019, plural ennyn, in Annon-in-Gelydh; cf. Morannon the \u2018Black Gate\u2019 of Mordor and Sirannon the \u2018Gate-stream\u2019 of Moria. ar- \u2018beside, outside\u2019 (whence Quenya ar \u2018and\u2019, Sindarin a), probably in Araman \u2018outside Aman\u2019; cf. also (Nirnaeth) Arnoediad \u2018(Tears) without reckoning\u2019. ar(a)- \u2018high, noble, royal\u2019 appears in a great many names, as Aradan, Aredhel, Argonath, Arnor, etc.; extended stem arat- appearing in Aratar, and in ar\u00e1to \u2018champion, eminent man\u2019, e.g. Angrod from Angar\u00e1to and Finrod from Findar\u00e1to; also aran \u2018king\u2019 in Aranr\u00fath. Ereinion \u2018scion of kings\u2019 (name of Gil-galad) has the plural of aran; cf. Fornost Erain \u2018Nor-bury of the Kings\u2019 in Arnor. The prefix Ar- of the Ad\u00fbnaic names of the Kings of N\u00famenor was derived from this. arien (the Maia of the Sun) is derived from a root as- seen also in Quenya \u00e1r\u00eb \u2018sunlight\u2019. atar \u2018father\u2019 in Atanat\u00e1ri (see Atani in Index), Il\u00favatar. band \u2018prison, duress\u2019 in Angband; from original mbando, of which the Quenya form appears in Mandos (Sindarin Ang-band = Quenya Angamando). bar \u2018dwelling\u2019 in Bar-en-Danwedh. The ancient word mb\u00e1r (Quenya m\u00e1r, Sindarin bar) meant the \u2018home\u2019 both of persons and of peoples, and thus appears in many place-names, as Brithombar, Dimbar (the first element of which means \u2018sad, gloomy\u2019), Eldamar, Val(i)mar, Vinyamar, Marnu-Falmar. Mardil, name of the first of the Ruling Stewards of Gondor, means \u2018devoted to the house\u2019 (i.e. of the Kings). barad \u2018tower\u2019 in Barad-d\u00fbr, Barad Eithel, Barad Nimras; the plural in Emyn Beraid. beleg \u2018mighty\u2019 in Beleg, Belegaer, Belegost, Laer C\u00fa Beleg. bragol \u2018sudden\u2019 in Dagor Bragollach. brethil probably means \u2018silver birch\u2019; cf. Nimbrethil the birch-woods in Arvernien, and Fimbrethil, one of the Entwives. brith \u2018gravel\u2019 in Brithiach, Brithombar, Brithon. (For many names beginning with C see entries under K) calen (galen) the usual Sindarin word for \u2018green\u2019, in Ard-galen, Tol Galen, Calenardhon; also in Parth Galen (\u2018Green Sward\u2019) beside Anduin and Pinnath Gelin (\u2018Green Ridges\u2019) in Gondor. See kal-. cam (from kamba) \u2018hand\u2019, but specifically of the hand held cupped in the attitude of receiving or holding, in Camlost, Erchamion. carak- This root is seen in Quenya carca \u2018fang\u2019, of which the Sindarin form carch occurs in Carcharoth, and also in Carchost (\u2018Fang Fort\u2019, one of the Towers of the Teeth at the entrance to Mordor). Cf. Caragd\u00fbr, Carach Angren (\u2018Iron Jaws\u2019, the rampart and dike guarding the entrance to Ud\u00fbn in Mordor), and Helcarax\u00eb. caran \u2018red\u2019, Quenya carn\u00eb, in Caranthir, Carnil, Orocarni; also in Caradhras, from caran-rass, the \u2018Red-horn\u2019 in the Misty Mountains, and Carnim\u00edri\u00eb \u2018red-jewelled\u2019, the rowan-tree in Quickbeam\u2019s song. The translation of Carcharoth in the text as \u2018Red Maw\u2019 must depend on association with this word; see carak-. celeb \u2018silver\u2019 (Quenya telep, telp\u00eb, as in Telperion) in Celeborn, Celebrant, Celebros. Celebrimbor means \u2018silver-fist\u2019, from the adjective celebrin \u2018silver\u2019 (meaning not \u2018made of silver\u2019 but \u2018like silver, in hue or worth\u2019) and paur (Quenya qu\u00e1r\u00eb) \u2018fist\u2019, often used to mean \u2018hand\u2019; the Quenya form of the name was Telperinquar. Celebrindal has celebrin and tal, dal \u2018foot\u2019. coron \u2018mound\u2019 in Corollair\u00eb (also called Coron Oiolair\u00eb, which latter word means \u2018Ever-summer\u2019, cf. Oioloss\u00eb); cf. Cerin Amroth, the great mound in Lothl\u00f3rien. c\u00fa \u2018bow\u2019 in C\u00fathalion, Dor C\u00faarthol, Laer C\u00fa Beleg. cuivi\u00eb \u2018awakening\u2019 in Cuivi\u00e9nen (Sindarin Nen Echui). Other derivatives of the same root are Dor Firn-i-Guinar; coir\u00eb, the first beginning of Spring, Sindarin echuir, The Lord of the Rings Appendix D; and coimas \u2018life-bread\u2019, Quenya name of lembas. cul- \u2018golden-red\u2019 in Cul\u00farien. curu \u2018skill\u2019 in Curufin(w\u00eb), Curun\u00edr. dae \u2018shadow\u2019 in Dor Daedeloth, and perhaps in Daeron. dagor \u2018battle\u2019; the root is ndak-, cf.

Quenya Endor \u2018Middle-earth\u2019 was from ened \u2018middle\u2019 and ndor; this in Sindarin became Ennor (cf. ennorath \u2018middle lands\u2019 in the chant A Elbereth Gilthoniel). draug \u2018wolf\u2019 in Draugluin. d\u00fa \u2018night, dimness\u2019 in Deld\u00fawath, Ephel D\u00faath. Derived from earlier dome, whence Quenya l\u00f3m\u00eb; thus Sindarin d\u00falin \u2018nightingale\u2019 corresponds to l\u00f3melind\u00eb. duin \u2018(long) river\u2019 in Anduin, Baranduin, Esgalduin, Malduin, Taur-im-Duinath. d\u00fbr \u2018dark\u2019 in Barad-d\u00fbr, Caragd\u00fbr, Dol Guldur; also in Durthang (a castle in Mordor). \u00ebar \u2018sea\u2019 (Quenya) in E\u00e4rendil, E\u00e4rr\u00e1m\u00eb, and many other names. The Sindarin word gaer (in Belegaer) is apparently derived from the same original stem. echor in Echoriath \u2018Encircling Mountains\u2019 and Orfalch Echor; cf. Rammas Echor \u2018the great wall of the outer circle\u2019 about the Pelennor Fields at Minas Tirith. edhel \u2018elf\u2019 (Sindarin) in Adanedhel, Aredhel, Gl\u00f3redhel, Ost-in-Edhil; also in Peredhil \u2018Half-elven\u2019. eithel \u2018well\u2019 in Eithel Ivrin, Eithel Sirion, Barad Eithel; also in Mitheithel, the river Hoarwell in Eriador (named from its source). See kel-. \u00eal, elen \u2018star\u2019. According to Elvish legend, ele was a primitive exclamation \u2018behold!\u2019 made by the Elves when they first saw the stars. From this origin derived the ancient words \u00eal and elen, meaning \u2018star\u2019, and the adjectives elda and elena, meaning \u2018of the stars\u2019. These elements appear in a great many names. For the later use of the name Eldar see the Index. The Sindarin equivalent of Elda was Edhel (plural Edhil), q.v.; but the strictly corresponding form was Eledh, which occurs in Eledhwen. er \u2018one, alone\u2019, in Amon Ereb (cf. Erebor, the Lonely Mountain), Erchamion, Eress\u00eba, Eru. ereg \u2018thorn, holly\u2019 in Eregion, Region. esgal \u2018screen, hiding\u2019 in Esgalduin. falas \u2018shore, line of surf\u2019 (Quenya falass\u00eb) in Falas, Belfalas; also Anfalas in Gondor. Cf. Falathar, Falathrim. Another derivative from the root was Quenya falma \u2018(crested) wave\u2019, whence Falmari, Mar-nu-Falmar. faroth is derived from a root meaning \u2018hunt, pursue\u2019; in the Lay of Leithian the Taur-en-Faroth above Nargothrond are called \u2018the Hills of the Hunters\u2019. faug- \u2018gape\u2019 in Anfauglir, Anfauglith, Dor-nu-Fauglith. f\u00eba \u2018spirit\u2019 in F\u00ebanor, F\u00ebanturi. fin- \u2018hair\u2019 in Finduilas, Fingon, Finrod, Glorfindel. formen \u2018north\u2019 (Quenya) in Formenos; Sindarin forn (also for, forod) in Fornost. fuin \u2018gloom, darkness\u2019 (Quenya huin\u00eb) in Fuinur, Taur-nu-Fuin. gaer \u2018sea\u2019 in Belegaer (and in Gaerys, Sindarin name of Oss\u00eb). Said to derive from the stem gaya \u2018awe, dread\u2019, and to have been the name made for the vast and terrifying Great Sea when the Eldar first came to its shores. gaur \u2018werewolf\u2019 (from a root ngwaw- \u2018howl\u2019) in Tol-in-Gaurhoth. gil \u2018star\u2019 in Dagor-nuin-Giliath, Osgiliath (giliath \u2018host of stars\u2019); Gil-Estel, Gil-galad. girith \u2018shuddering\u2019 in Nen Girith; cf. also Girithron, name of the last month of the year in Sindarin (The Lord of the Rings Appendix D). gl\u00een \u2018gleam\u2019 (particularly applied to the eyes) in Maeglin. golodh is the Sindarin form of Quenya Noldo; see g\u00fbl. Plural Golodhrim, and Gelydh (in Annon-in-Gelydh). gond \u2018stone\u2019 in Gondolin, Gondor, Gonnhirrim, Argonath, seregon. The name of the hidden city of King Turgon was devised by him in Quenya as Ondolind\u00eb (Quenya ondo = Sindarin gond, and lind\u00eb \u2018singing, song\u2019); but it was known always in legend in the Sindarin form Gondolin, which was probably interpreted as gond-dolen \u2018Hidden Rock\u2019. gor \u2018horror, dread\u2019 in Gorthaur, Gorthol; goroth of the same meaning, with reduplicated gor,in Gorgoroth, Ered Gorgoroth. groth (grod) \u2018delving, underground dwelling\u2019 in Menegroth, Nogrod (probably also in Nimrodel, \u2018lady of the white cave\u2019). Nogrod was originally Novrod \u2018hollow delving\u2019 (hence the translation Hollowbold), but was altered under the influence of naug \u2018dwarf\u2019. g\u00fbl \u2018sorcery\u2019 in Dol Guldur, Minas Morgul. This word was derived from the same ancient stem ngol- that appears in Noldor; cf. Quenya n\u00f3l\u00eb \u2018long study, lore, knowledge\u2019. But the Sindarin word was darkened in sense by its frequent use in the compound morgul \u2018black arts\u2019. gurth \u2018death\u2019 in Gurthang (see also Melkor in the Index). gwaith \u2018people\u2019 in Gwaith-i-Mirdain; cf. Enedwaith \u2018Middle-folk\u2019, name of the land between the Greyflood and the Isen. gwath, wath \u2018shadow\u2019 in Deld\u00fawath, Ephel D\u00faath; also in Gwathl\u00f3, the river Greyflood in Eriador. Related forms in Ered Wethrin, Thuringwethil. (This Sindarin word referred to dim light, not to the shadows of objects cast by light: these were called morchaint \u2018dark shapes\u2019.) hadhod in Hadhodrond (translation of Khazad-d\u00fbm) was a rendering of Khaz\u00e2d into Sindarin sounds. haudh \u2018mound\u2019 in Haudh-en-Arwen, Haudh-en-Elleth, etc. heru \u2018lord\u2019 in Herumor, Herun\u00famen; Sindarin h\u00eer in Gonnhirrim, Rohirrim, Barahir; h\u00edril \u2018lady\u2019 in H\u00edrilorn. him \u2018cool\u2019 in Himlad (and Himring?). h\u00edni \u2018children\u2019 in Eruh\u00edni \u2018Children of Eru\u2019; Narn i H\u00een H\u00farin. h\u00eeth \u2018mist\u2019 in Hithaeglir, Hithlum (also in Nen Hithoel, a lake in Anduin). Hithlum is Sindarin in form, adapted from the Quenya name H\u00edsil\u00f3m\u00eb given by the Noldorin exiles (Quenya h\u00edsi\u00eb \u2018mist\u2019, cf. H\u00edsim\u00eb, the name of the eleventh month of the year, The Lord of the Rings Appendix D). hoth \u2018host, horde\u2019 (nearly always in a bad sense) in Tol-in-Gaurhoth; also in Loss(h)oth, the Snowmen of Forochel (The Lord of the Rings Appendix A (I, iii)) and Glamhoth \u2018din-horde\u2019, a name for Orcs. hyarmen \u2018south\u2019 (Quenya) in Hyarmentir; Sindarin har-, harn, harad. i\u00e2 \u2018void, abyss\u2019 in Moria. iant \u2018bridge\u2019 in Iant Iaur. i\u00e2th \u2018fence\u2019 in Doriath. iaur \u2018old\u2019 in Iant Iaur; cf. the Elvish name of Bombadil, Iarwain. ilm- This stem appears in Ilmen, Ilmar\u00eb, and also in Ilmarin (\u2018mansion of the high airs\u2019, the dwelling of Manw\u00eb and Varda upon Oioloss\u00eb). il\u00fav\u00eb \u2018the whole, the all\u2019 in Il\u00favatar. kal- (gal-) This root, meaning \u2018shine\u2019, appears in Calacirya, Calaquendi, Tar-calion; galvorn, Gil-galad, Galadriel. The last two names have no connexion with Sindarin galadh \u2018tree\u2019, although in the case of Galadriel such a connexion was often made, and the name altered to Galadhriel. In the High-elven speech her name was Al(a)t\u00e1riel, derived from alata \u2018radiance\u2019 (Sindarin galad) and riel \u2018garlanded maiden\u2019 (from a root rig- \u2018twine, wreathe\u2019): the whole meaning \u2018maiden crowned with a radiant garland\u2019, referring to her hair. calen (galen) \u2018green\u2019 is etymologically \u2018bright\u2019, and derives from this root; see also aglar. k\u00e1no \u2018commander\u2019: this Quenya word is the origin of the second element in Fingon and Turgon. kel- \u2018go away\u2019, of water \u2018flow away, flow down\u2019, in Celon; from et-kele \u2018issue of water, spring\u2019 was derived, with transposition of the consonants, Quenya ehtel\u00eb, Sindarin eithel. kemen \u2018earth\u2019 in Kement\u00e1ri; a Quenya word referring to the earth as a flat floor beneath menel, the heavens. khelek- \u2018ice\u2019 in Helcar, Helcarax\u00eb (Quenya helka \u2018icy, ice-cold\u2019). But in Helevorn the first element is Sindarin heledh \u2018glass\u2019, taken from Khuzdul kheled (cf. Kheled-z\u00e2ram \u2018Mirrormere\u2019); Helevorn means \u2018black glass\u2019 (cf. galvorn). khil- \u2018follow\u2019 in Hildor, Hild\u00f3rien, Eluchil. kir- \u2018cut, cleave\u2019 in Calacirya, Cirth, Angerthas, Cirith (Ninniach, Thoronath). From the sense \u2018pass swiftly through\u2019 was derived Quenya c\u00edrya \u2018sharp-prowed ship\u2019 (cf. English cutter), and this meaning appears also in C\u00edrdan, Tar-Ciryatan, and no doubt in the name of Isildur\u2019s son Ciryon. lad \u2018plain, valley\u2019 in Dagorlad, Himlad; imlad a narrow valley with steep sides, in Imladris (cf. also Imlad Morgul in the Ephel D\u00faath). laur\u00eb \u2018gold\u2019 (but of light and colour, not of the metal) in Laurelin; the Sindarin forms in Gl\u00f3redhel, Glorfindel, Loeg Ningloron, L\u00f3rindol, Rathl\u00f3riel. lhach \u2018leaping flame\u2019 in Dagor Bragollach, and probably in Anglachel (the sword made by E\u00f6l of meteoritic iron). lin (1) \u2018pool, mere\u2019 in Linaewen (which contains aew (Quenya aiw\u00eb) \u2018small bird\u2019), Teiglin; cf. aelin. lin- (2) This root, meaning \u2018sing, make a musical sound\u2019, occurs in Ainulindal\u00eb, Laurelin, Lindar, Lindon, Ered Lindon, l\u00f3melindi. lith \u2018ash\u2019 in Anfauglith, Dor-nu-Fauglith; also in Ered Lithui, the Ashen Mountains, forming the northern border of Mordor, and Lithlad \u2018Plain of Ashes\u2019 at the feet of Ered Lithui. lok- \u2018bend, loop\u2019 in Urul\u00f3ki (Quenya (h)l\u00f3k\u00eb \u2018snake, serpent\u2019, Sindarin lh\u00fbg). l\u00f3m \u2018echo\u2019 in Dor-l\u00f3min, Ered L\u00f3min; related are Lammoth, Lanthir Lamath. l\u00f3m\u00eb \u2018dusk\u2019 in L\u00f3mion, l\u00f3melindi; see d\u00fa. lond\u00eb \u2018land-locked haven\u2019 in Alqualond\u00eb; the Sindarin form lond (lonn) in Mithlond. los \u2018snow\u2019 in Oioloss\u00eb (Quenya oio \u2018ever\u2019 and loss\u00eb \u2018snow, snow-white\u2019); Sindarin loss in Amon Uilos and Aeglos. loth \u2018flower\u2019 in Lothl\u00f3rien, Nimloth; Quenya l\u00f3t\u00eb in Ninquel\u00f3t\u00eb, Vingil\u00f3t\u00eb. luin \u2018blue\u2019 in Ered Luin, Helluin, Luinil, Mindolluin. maeg \u2018sharp, piercing\u2019 (Quenya maika) in Maeglin. mal- \u2018gold\u2019 in Malduin, Malinalda; also in mallorn, and in the Field of Cormallen, which means \u2018golden circle\u2019 and was named from the culumalda trees that grew there (see cul-). man- \u2018good, blessed, unmarred\u2019 in Aman, Manw\u00eb; derivatives of Aman in Amandil, Araman,\u00damanyar. mel- \u2018love\u2019 in Melian (from Melyanna \u2018dear gift\u2019); this stem is seen also in the Sindarin word mellon \u2018friend\u2019 in the inscription on the West-gate of Moria. men \u2018way\u2019 in N\u00famen, Hyarmen, R\u00f3men, Formen. menel \u2018the heavens\u2019 in Meneldil, Menelmacar, Meneltarma. mereth \u2018feast\u2019 in Mereth Aderthad; also in Merethrond, the Hall of Feasts in Minas Tirith. minas \u2018tower\u2019 in Ann\u00faminas, Minas Anor, Minas Tirith, etc. The same stem occurs in other words referring to isolated, prominent, things, e.g. Mindolluin, Mindon; probably related is Quenya minya \u2018first\u2019 (cf. Tar-Minyatur, the name of Elros as first King of N\u00famenor). m\u00eer \u2018jewel\u2019 (Quenya m\u00edr\u00eb)in Elemm\u00edr\u00eb, Gwaith-i-M\u00edrdain, M\u00edriel, Nauglam\u00edr, Tar-Atanamir. mith \u2018grey\u2019 in Mithlond, Mithrandir, Mithrim; also in Mitheithel, the river Hoarwell in Eriador. mor \u2018dark\u2019 in Mordor, Morgoth, Moria, Moriquendi, Mormegil, Morwen, etc. moth \u2018dusk\u2019 in Nan Elmoth. nan(d) \u2018valley\u2019 in Nan Dungortheb, Nan Elmoth, Nan Tathren. n\u00e1r \u2018fire\u2019 in Narsil, Narya; present also in the original forms of Aegnor (Aikan\u00e1ro \u2018Sharp Flame\u2019 or \u2018Fell Fire\u2019) and F\u00ebanor (F\u00eban\u00e1ro \u2018Spirit of Fire\u2019). The Sindarin form was naur, as in Sammath Naur, the Chambers of Fire in Orodruin. Derived from the same ancient root (a)nar was the name of the Sun, Quenya Anar (also in An\u00e1rion), Sindarin Anor (cf. Minas Anor, An\u00f3rien). naug \u2018dwarf\u2019 in Naugrim; see also Nogrod in entry groth. Related is another Sindarin word for \u2018dwarf\u2019, nogoth, plural noegyth (Noegyth Nibin \u2018Petty-dwarves\u2019) and nogothrim. -(n)dil is a very frequent ending of personal names, Amandil, E\u00e4rendil (shortened E\u00e4rnil), Elendil, Mardil, etc.; it implies \u2018devotion\u2019, \u2018disinterested love\u2019 (see Mardil in entry bar). -(n)dur in names such as E\u00e4rendur (shortened E\u00e4rnur) is similar in meaning to -(n)dil. neldor \u2018beech\u2019 in Neldoreth; but it seems that this was properly the name of H\u00edrilorn, the great beech-tree with three trunks (neld\u00eb \u2018three\u2019 and orn). nen \u2018water\u2019, used of lakes, pools, and lesser rivers, in Nen Girith, Nenning, Nenuial, Nenya; Cuivi\u00e9nen, Uinen; also in many names in The Lord of the Rings,as Nen Hithoel, Bruinen, Emyn Arnen, N\u00farnen. N\u00een \u2018wet\u2019 in Loeg Ningloron; also in Nindalf. nim \u2018white\u2019 (from earlier nimf, nimp) in Nimbrethil, Nimloth, Nimphelos, niphredil (niphred \u2018pallor\u2019), Barad Nimras, Ered Nimrais. The Quenya form was ninqu\u00eb; thus Ninquel\u00f3t\u00eb = Nimloth. Cf. also Taniquetil. orn \u2018tree\u2019 in Celeborn, H\u00edrilorn; cf. Fangorn \u2018Treebeard\u2019, and mallorn, plural mellyrn, the trees of Lothl\u00f3rien. orod \u2018mountain\u2019 in Orodruin, Thangorodrim; Orocarni, Oromet.

The Sindarin forms have p (or b) for qu; e.g. pedo \u2018speak\u2019 in the inscription on the West-gate of Moria, corresponding to the Quenya stem quet-, and Gandalf\u2019s words before the gate, lasto beth lammen \u2018listen to the words of my tongue\u2019, where beth \u2018word\u2019 corresponds to Quenya quetta. ram \u2018wall\u2019 (Quenya ramba)in Andram, Ramdal; also in Rammas Echor, the wall about the Pelennor Fields at Minas Tirith. ran- \u2018wander, stray\u2019 in R\u00e1na, the Moon, and in Mithrandir, Aerandir; also in the river Gilraen in Gondor. rant \u2018course\u2019 in the river-names Adurant (with adu \u2018double\u2019) and Celebrant (\u2018Silverlode\u2019). ras \u2018horn\u2019 in Barad Nimras, also in Caradhras (\u2018Redhorn\u2019) and Methedras (\u2018Last Peak\u2019) in the Misty Mountains; plural rais in Ered Nimrais. rauko \u2018demon\u2019 in Valaraukar; Sindarin raug, rog in Balrog. ril \u2018brilliance\u2019 in Idril, Silmaril; also in And\u00faril (the sword of Aragorn) and in mithril (Moria-silver). Idril\u2019s name in Quenya form was Itarill\u00eb (or Itarild\u00eb), from a stem ita-\u2018sparkle\u2019. rim \u2018great number, host\u2019 (Quenya rimb\u00eb) was commonly used to form collective plurals, as Golodhrim, Mithrim (see the Index), Naugrim, Thangorodrim, etc. ring \u2018cold, chill\u2019 in Ringil, Ringwil, Himring; also in the river Ringl\u00f3 in Gondor, and in Ringar\u00eb, Quenya name of the last month of the year (The Lord of the Rings Appendix D). ris \u2018cleave\u2019 appears to have blended with the stem kris- of similar meaning (a derivative of the root kir- \u2018cleave, cut\u2019, q.v.); hence Angrist (also Orcrist \u2018Orc-cleaver\u2019, the sword of Thorin Oakenshield), Crissaegrim, Imladris. roch \u2018horse\u2019 (Quenya rokko)in Rochallor, Rohan (from Rochand \u2018land of horses\u2019), Rohirrim; also in Roheryn \u2018horse of the lady\u2019 (cf. heru), Aragorn\u2019s horse, which was so called because given to him by Arwen (The Return of the King V 2). rom- A stem used of the sound of trumpets and horns which appears in Orom\u00eb and Valar\u00f3ma; cf.

The Sindarin words for \u2018east\u2019, rh\u00fbn (in Talath Rh\u00fanen) and amr\u00fbn, were of the same origin. rond meant a vaulted or arched roof, or a large hall or chamber so roofed; so Nargothrond (see ost), Hadhodrond, Aglarond. It could be applied to the heavens, hence the name Elrond \u2018star-dome\u2019. ros \u2018foam, spindrift, spray\u2019 in Celebros, Elros, Rauros; also in Cair Andros, an island in the river Anduin. ruin \u2018red flame\u2019 (Quenya r\u00fanya) in Orodruin. r\u00fbth \u2018anger\u2019 in Aranr\u00fath. sarn \u2018(small) stone\u2019 in Sarn Athrad (Sarn Ford on the Brandywine is a half-translation of this); also in Sarn Gebir (\u2018stone-spikes\u2019: ceber, plural cebir \u2018stakes\u2019), rapids in the river Anduin.
